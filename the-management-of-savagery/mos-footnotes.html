  <p id="footnote-0">* My goal in marking up this PDF in HTML is to make it more widely available as source material for journalists and op-ed writers. I've remained very faithful to the material as it was presented in the PDF. The only area which I took true liberty was in formatting the numerous ordered lists via the HTML element. This is most reflected in the topic section headings, where "Section One:", "(1)", and "First Article:" all became "1." The only other areas I took libery in were purely navigational. Content within the Second Topic is separated into sections just as the third, fourth, and fifth topics are, though in the original PDF there was no reference to them in the table of contents. I added those direct links in the table of contents, along with adding direct links at the beginning of each topic to its sections. Lastly, I consolodated all footnotes to the bottom of the page and provided readers direct links between reference and footnote.</p>

  <p id="footnote-1">1.</a> Until the September 11 operation came, they had also abandoned much of what was on paper and followed their forbearers among the Brethren. <a data-scroll href="#note-1">(Back)</a></p>

  <p id="footnote-2">2.</a> This is also what was planned, in another form, for Afghanistan during the rule of the Taliban before the events of September. In that case, (the plan was to) exhaust it with long sanctions, then press a button at the appropriate moment to transfer money and arms to the opposition and support them with people from neighboring countries, annihilating that state. That's the least one could expect. Thus, the possibility of direct intervention under any pretext is also proven. <a data-scroll href="#note-2">(Back)</a></p>

  <p id="footnote-12">12.</a> The nature of cities in the modern age is such that they do not have regimes of tribal leaders and great men; rather, security systems control them. The modern city almost necessitates emigration from rural areas and the deserts and the semi-alienation of the people due to that social phenomenon. Even the rural areas and the deserts support the modern Jahiliyya regime in dispersing and dissolving the tribes of solidarity and the clans so that it may exercise its control over them or perversely reorient those tribes of solidarity towards a Jahiliyya direction which serves its goals. However, there are many rural areas and deserts and some cities which have groups that preserve their traditions, (even though) that regime is present to a certain extent. <a data-scroll href="#note-12">(Back)</a></p>

  <p id="footnote-13">13.</a> "Gradual defensive battle" is a technical term which the leaders of the institutions movement teach. <a data-scroll href="#note-13">(Back)</a></p>

  <p id="footnote-14">14.</a> I do not know anyone more learned in the sharia in the modern period who specializes in education in terms of study, experience, and practice than Shaykh Muhammad Amin al-Misri (may God have mercy on him). This Shaykh was born in Damascus in 1914 and died (may God have mercy on him) in the year 1977 (1397 A.H.) after a surgical operation in Switzerland. (His remains) were transferred to blessed Mecca and he was buried there (may God have great mercy upon him and may God recompense him well).
  <br><br>
  He is considered one of the most prominent ulama of Syria in the last one hundred years and he obtained his university degree from the Usul al-Din College at al-Azhar&#8212;perhaps that was the reason he was called al-Misri&#8212;where he obtained a doctorate in the subject of "Criterions of Criticism Used by the Traditionists."
  <br><br>
  Whoever reads some of the research of the Shaykh sees his talent for the sciences of exegesis and hadith, and the subjects of faith and dogma. And one who reads it also knows how he specialized in studying psychology and its connection with education and the comparison between the Islamic method of education, other, Western methods, and others, (and knows that) he has studies and penetrating research on (these subjects)&#8212;it was appreciated by his students in the journal "al-Bayan wa al-Sunna" before (others) appreciated it. As for educational practice, this Shaykh (may God bless him) had an experience taken from the effect of the experiences of the modern missionaries and the ulama since this Shaykh communicated, during his studies in Egypt, with Shaykh Hasan al-Banna during a period filled with momentous events in the history of the Muslim Brethren. Likewise, during the period of his work in Pakistan, he communicated with Shaykh Mawdudi (may God bless him). Even more important than that was during the years of his work in which he was busy with teaching, education, and administration in different Sunni countries, environments, and stages in the regions of Muslims. He taught in secondary schools in Damascus for a period of time and during his job in Pakistan he worked to spread the Arabic language among the sons of Pakistan and he has a book regarding the teaching of the Arabic language to non-Arabs. He also taught in the College of Sharia in blessed Mecca and participated in establishing the Department of Higher Studies init. Three years before his death, he moved to the Islamic University in brilliant Medina and served as chair of the Department of Higher Studies in it and he had a role in putting its methods in place. Therefore, there is no doubt that the generation which graduated from these two universities in the peninsula and lead the youth today were influenced by this scholar and esteemed educator and paid attention to him.
  <br><br>
  I previously mentioned that the origin of the study of education was a debate for the Qutbi current in Egypt. This designation has no connection with the formation of the groups which illegitimately call themselves "Qutbis". The origin of this name is a long story that has no importance.
  <br><br>
  The book focused on this current, especially since it was the most numerous and the oldest of the currents in terms of giving the (sharia) foundation for the understanding which we seek in this book. Even most of the courses which became famous after that took almost all of their proofs from this current.
  <br><br>
  Several years ago, I met in some place with one of the leaders of this course and the following conversation occurred between us (what I will relate is partial and is the thrust of the conversation):
  <br><br>
  He said to me, asking: "Do the groups of jihad continue following the policy of "scorched earth" and use their propaganda to denigrate the remaining currents as punishment for not acting according to the same method, as has happened in Algeria and now in Egypt?"
  <br><br>
  (The discussion was when there were burning operations in Egypt and Algeria.)
  <br><br>
  I said to him: "If you mean by the policy of "scorched earth" that it is the method of the groups of jihad to designate those who do not fight out of choice as those who fight out of compulsion, then that is correct. And you will sometimes see the movements and the masses in the land of battle, whether they want to or not."
  <br><br>
  He said to me: "The youth must take enough time for education and likewise the masses until they are ready for battle."
  <br><br>
  I said to him: "What kind of education are you talking about? It is your concept of education that is the problem. So that I may draw close to you and not estrange you, do you know Shaykh Muhammad Amin al-Misri? He is the most specialized of the ulama in education."
  <br><br>
  He said: "Yes, I have studied several of his books with him."
  <br><br>
  I said to him: "The method of education which the groups of jihad present is the same method which the Shaykh presents."
  <br><br>
  He said to me, smiling: "Look at the practical application which the students of the Shaykh have undertaken&#8212;this was when they were managing the two journals al-Sunna and al-Bayan&#8212;or even look at the life of the Shaykh himself and there is no doubt that it will explain what he meant by his words."
  <br><br>
  I said to him: "It appears that you have not read the clear, blunt passages in which this Shaykh spoke about the prophetic method of education. First of all, turn away from his students, for they have changed his friendly admonitions beyond all recognition. As for the life of the Shaykh, he mentioned in more than one place in his books and his lectures that he is not satisfied with his experience in Islamic activism and he hoped that his students will be honest with themselves just as he was, even to the final discussion which took place between us."
  <br><br>
  So what did Muhammad al-Amin al-Misri say about himself and what did he present as the ideal method of education?
  <br><br>
  The Shaykh (may God have mercy on him) said: "I swear by the Truth that I deem my days to be fruitless and my soul to be base and lowly, not having advanced beyond the stage of childhood and not having attained maturity or tasted the meaning of manhood. If I were asked to write an appraisal of myself, I would say:
  <ol>
  <li>He is not content with his level of faith and he does not think that a level like this can have a clear effect on his students.</li>
  <li>He is not satisfied with his work and he does not carry it out, although he is confident that the path which he walks is that which will lead to the salvation of the Umma. There are no methods and no procedures in which students have been trained that will bring forth heroes and missionaries for the Umma. Therefore, he considers himself to be a laborer doing what pleases the boss for the sake of (his) livelihood. Perhaps many people will be surprised by these words."</li>
  </ol>
  The Shaykh bared his soul by being honest with himself, hoping that some will do the same, even though one who reads his biography sees how his efforts and his accomplishments surpassed many of those who claim understanding, wisdom, carefully studied efforts, and lengthy individual planning, and other slogans. <a data-scroll href="#note-14">(Back)</a></p>

  <p id="footnote-24">24.</a> This is the assertion of one of the shaykhs which we cite as proof to his followers, when he was asked why the Shaykh al-Islam Muhammad Ibn `Abd al-Wahhab&#8212;may God have mercy on him&#8212;hastened the movement of those with him. If he was patient for a longer period of time, he could have established a large state and a caliphate (by God, where is the shame of those who asked this question)? He responded: "The judicious missionary does not abandon his followers as spoils for the enemies for a long period of time. Otherwise, that would lead to the dwindling away of the followers."<br><br>
  There is no doubt that the questioner and the one who voices the sentiments of a group from among the currents in the Islamic middle is shameless. He asked this question while the members of the currents which he represents live the entire length of their lives and die for the sake of achieving paltry goals, such as studying in a mosque by the permission of the Taghut, or (establishing) a charitable institution beneath the authority and supervision of the Taghut, or (striving for) a goal sullied by polytheism, such as membership in a parliament or being a minister in the Taghut government. If only he were independent in his ministry and judged according to the sharia! But he is part of the Taghut order. Days go by and generations die and those acquisitions are stripped from them. New generations start the cycle anew for the sake of the same acquisitions&#8212;there is no power or strength save by God. Afterwards, they criticize an imam who established a state [i.e. Ibn `Abd al-Wahhab] and he only fell short in its expansion because of questioners like this one, who only desire to refrain from the attack. <a data-scroll href="#note-24">(Back)</a></p>

  <p id="footnote-25">25.</a> Refer to what I quoted from the newspapers of the enemies concerning the reports of the specialists in psychological and mental health in the armies of America and its allies before and after the invasion. (They report that) some of (the troops) suffer from epilepsy and madness. <a data-scroll href="#note-25">(Back)</a></p>

  <p id="footnote-26">26.</a> There is no organization called the Irish Red Army and perhaps the opponent&#8212;who we mentioned at the beginning of this article and who considers himself and his followers to be historians of the salafi, reformist current in Egypt&#8212;meant the Irish Republican Army! <a data-scroll href="#note-26">(Back)</a></p>

  <p id="footnote-27">27.</a> Those who want more should refer to article 87 and article 97 of "Articles Between Two Methods" by Shaykh `Umar Mahmud Abu `Umar (may God release him from his captivity). I have quoted frequently from both of them in order to clarify the subject dealt with in this article. <a data-scroll href="#note-27">(Back)</a></p>

  <p id="footnote-28">28.</a> Those whom the newspapers and television programs attribute with bravery and wisdom and the publications and television programs which publish their statements practiced terrorism and assassination which everyone practices, whether wrongly or rightly. I ask God to facilitate the publication of an independent treatise in which there is a history of rulers and leaders of parties in the abodes of Muslims who carried out massacres and assassination themselves when they were youth, while they are now the most vociferous of the people in repudiating terrorism and claiming that the return to religion afflicts the Umma with killing and disunion. If we contemplate the history of their parties, their great leaders, and their ideology without blindness, we would find that most of them are behind the tribulations and blood which has been shed in the Umma. <a data-scroll href="#note-28">(Back)</a></p>

  <p id="footnote-29">29.</a> When the jihad was ignited in Egypt in the beginning of the 90s of the previous century, the Brethren joined with Shenuda, leader of the Orthodox sect, the largest of the Christian sects in Egypt, who had previously recorded tapes distributed among the Christians in which he flagrantly cursed the Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him). And it was proven that in the 70s he used to gather weapons and direct conspiracies, like what happened in al-Zawiya al-Hamra' and what followed. Likewise, before meeting with the Brethren directly, he plainly spoke evil of our religion, ridiculing some of the laws of the sharia which decree "not giving allegiance to a nonbeliever". He also maintained that it is impossible to apply the sharia in Egypt on account of his rejection of that law, so that the Christians would not become second-class citizens. I say that the Brethren joined with this criminal in order to condemn terrorism.<br><br>When they came to him, he responded by saying: "Is one who does that [i.e. engages in terrorism] someone who drank from the Nile of Egypt and was raised upon its dust?!" They said, "No, he is not a son of this nation", and so forth. Hasan Dawh, one of the leading members of the Brethren, published the text of the meeting in an article he authored in which he boasted about that meeting.<br><br>
  The Brethren forgot that God is the Creator of this Nile and all of these blessings which they attribute to the earth and the nation! That is the extent of (their understanding) of tawhid, to say nothing of the disbelief of the Christians in God and their worship of someone other than Him. I beseech God to send down upon them the punishment they deserve. <a data-scroll href="#note-29">(Back)</a></p>
