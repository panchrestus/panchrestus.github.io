    <p><small>23 May 2006 [Translator's Note: Numbers in brackets refer to the page number in the original text. My comments in brackets are meant to clarify obscure passages or allusions in the text. Generally, Naji's parenthetical statements are set off by em-dashes, as they are in the original text, although sometimes I have put them in parentheses. When rendering some sentences, I have added phrases in parentheses to make them more readable in English. The differences between Naji's parenthetical statements and my own additions will be very obvious. Finally, the reader will please excuse any infelicities in my translation of the text. I have not had the time to carefully check it against the Arabic original or to polish the English prose. Any feedback from readers will be most welcome. &#8212;W.M., May 2005]</small></p>
