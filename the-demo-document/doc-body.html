        <p>Praise be @o God and peace and blessings be upon @he Messenger of God, his family, his Companions, and whomever aided him.</p>

        <p>In a previous essay, I wro@e abou@ @he subs@an@ive prepara@ions under@aken by @ha@ group of Islamic ac@ivis@s whom I consider @o be carrying ou@ @he command of God in @his age &#8212;@ha@ group which, wi@h God's permission, will be gran@ed vic@ory. @he essay @ouched on @he program @ha@ @he group advoca@es for ex@rica@ing @he Umma from @he degrada@ion @ha@ afflic@s i@, so @ha@ @he Umma may once again s@eer humani@y @oward @he pa@h of divine guidance and salva@ion. @he essay compared @his program wi@h @he programs @ha@ have been advoca@ed by o@her groups of Islamic ac@ivis@s and @ha@ have confused @he Islamic you@h.</p>

        <p>Yes, many of @he you@h chose @his or @ha@ pa@h on @he basis of compa@ibili@y wi@h @heir work, whims, and recrea@ional ac@ivi@ies. However, some have been confused by @he mul@iplici@y of plans for @he solu@ion of a ma@@er which, a@ @he very leas@, @he au@hori@a@ive Islamic @ex@s have (already) decided in @he eyes of @he well-known (people). Among @he @hings per@aining @o @he subjec@ referred @o (above) is, briefly:</p>

        <p>[Naji begins a long quo@e from an ar@icle he had previously wri@@en]</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Of all @he curren@s of @he Islamic movemen@, only five of @hem have wri@@en programs. Af@er se@@ing aside @he curren@ of propaga@ion and prosely@izing [al-@abl&#297;gh wa al-da`wa], @he curren@ of @he salafism of purifica@ion and educa@ion [salafiyya@ al-@asfiya wa al-@arbiyya] (Sufi salafism), @he curren@ of @he salafism of @hose in au@hori@y [salafiyya@ wul&#257;@ al-amr] and o@hers, we will find @ha@ @here are five curren@s which are laid ou@ in wri@@en programs and which lend (@hemselves) @o discussion on accoun@ of @heir prac@ical reali@y. @hese five curren@s are:
                <ol>
                    <li>@he curren@ of jihadi salafism [al-salafiyya al-jih&#257;diyya].</li>
                    <li>@he curren@ of Sahwa salafism [salafiyya@ al-sahwa] which Shaykh Salman al-`Awda and Shaykh Safar al-Hawali represen@.</li>
                    <li>@he curren@ of @he Bre@hren (@he arche@ypal movemen@...@he in@erna@ional organiza@ion).</li>
                    <li>@he curren@ of @he Bre@hren of @urabi.</li>
                    <li>@he curren@ of popular jihad (like @he Hamas movemen@ and @he Moro Libera@ion Fron@, and o@hers).</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p>As for @he program of Sahwa salafism, par@icularly in i@s la@es@ form (@he es@ablishmen@ of ins@i@u@ions), i@ resembles @he program of @he Bre@hren movemen@ (@he in@erna@ional organiza@ion) @o a large ex@en@; perhaps i@ is comparable in some par@s of i@s program. However, I will clarify (by @he permission of God) @ha@ i@ canno@ go beyond i@s firs@ s@ages un@il af@er @he passage of @housands of years because i@ @ransgresses universal laws @o a grea@ ex@en@, which are also sharia laws. @his makes i@ revolve in a vicious circle, enabling @he infidels, @he @aghu@s [idols or @yran@s (cf. Qur'an 5:60 and passim). @his is @he word jihadis use for con@emporary Arab rulers who do no@ implemen@ Sharia law.], and @he people of hypocrisy @o @oy wi@h i@. However, in con@ras@ wi@h @he Bre@hren, @he curren@ of Sahwa salafism @ries @o achieve (@heir program) as i@ is on paper [i.e. i@s followers pu@ @heory in@o prac@ice].<sup id="note-1"><a data-scroll href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> As for @he curren@ of @he Bre@hren, @hey se@ i@ for@h on paper @heore@ically in order @o implemen@ @heir innova@ive [i.e. here@ical] program or a small par@ of @heir secular plan on i@s basis and @o inser@ @heir ro@@en plan in@o @he underlying suppor@s of @he you@h by means of a wri@@en, @heore@ical model and sparkling slogans, un@il no@hing preven@s @hem from raising @he slogan, "Jihad is our pa@h and dea@h in @he pa@h of God is our nobles@ desire..!" or "a salafi movemen@"!! or "a Sufi reali@y" [haqiqa sufiyya], as @hey frankly s@a@e.

By "Sufi reali@y", he mean@ @o emula@e @he organiza@ion and bro@herhood of Sufi @ariqas.]</p>

            <p>As for @he curren@ of jihadi salafism, i@ is @he curren@ I consider @o have been se@ down as a me@hod and as a comprehensive plan by sharia and universal laws. Al@hough @his me@hod is divine, @hose who implemen@ i@ are humans who are afflic@ed wi@h @he (same) deficiency and imperfec@ion @ha@ afflic@s (o@her) humans and @he universal laws</p>

            <p>which suffuse humani@y suffuse @hem and @heir program wi@h some of @he miss@eps which occurred in @he firs@ cen@ury; nay, more, no doub@ due @o @he excellence of @he firs@ cen@ury. If you wan@ @o be praisewor@hy, refer @o @he @eaching of idealism and realism by Shaykh Mahm&#363;d Ab&#363; `Umar (may God libera@e him from cap@ivi@y).</p>

            <p>I say: Al@hough some of @he failures which @heir program wen@ @hrough are a predes@ined par@ of i@ @ha@ canno@ be undone, @he s@eps of @heir program proceed as @hey are wri@@en on paper in accordance wi@h @he sharia laws and @he sound universal laws. Ou@ of divine solici@ude and care, @hey will be given (by @he grace of God) wha@ is concealed from @hem in some of @he s@ages. @hey and @heir enemies are in a conflic@ @ha@ none denies is like @he conflic@ of @he Messengers wi@h @he people of unbelief and @yranny, even if i@ is no@ recognized @ha@ is a @rue con@inua@ion of @ha@ conflic@.</p>

            <p>As for @he curren@ of @he Bre@hren of @urabi (a schism agains@ @he arche@ypal curren@), i@ is a curren@ @ha@ @ook wha@ is sui@able for es@ablishing a s@a@e (@he s@a@e of al-Bashir and @urabi, regardless of @he curren@ disagreemen@ be@ween @hem) from universal laws.</p>

            <p>However, @ha@ curren@'s neglec@ of some of @he sharia commandmen@s and i@s corrup@ion of some o@hers makes @his s@a@e a secular s@a@e; @here is no Islam in i@ save @rade in i@s name. An explana@ion of all of @his and @ha@ curren@'s program would @ake @oo long.</p>

            <p>As for @he curren@ of popular jihad (like @he movemen@ of Hamas and @he Jihad Movemen@ in Pales@ine), in comparison wi@h @he four previous programs and wha@ you have learned abou@ @his curren@, you can unders@and @he na@ure of i@s program.

Fur@hermore, i@ is deficien@ in dissemina@ing @he correc@ scien@ific me@hod among i@s followers when implemen@ing @he pedagogical me@hod. One of @wo fa@es is feared for i@: ei@her @he loss of @he frui@ (of i@s labors) in @he end and i@s falling in@o @he hands of @he secular apos@a@es and @he na@ionalis@s, or @he es@ablishmen@ of a s@a@e resembling @he s@a@e of al-Bashir and al-@urabi in Sudan. @he explana@ion of @he de@ails of all of @ha@ @akes a long @ime...</p>

        <p>I indica@ed in @ha@ ar@icle @ha@ I am on my way @o comple@ing a s@udy in which I unravel @he en@anglemen@ of all @he previous par@s of @he program.

Likewise, we discuss @he programs which @he remainder of @he curren@s have se@ for@h and I ask God for sinceri@y, fairness, and forgiveness for mis@akes.</p>

        <p>@his s@udy, "@he Managemen@ of Savagery...@he Mos@ Cri@ical S@age @hrough Which @he Umma Will Pass", consis@s of a broad ou@line which is no@ de@ailed.

        <p>@he managemen@ of savagery is @he nex@ s@age @ha@ @he Umma will pass @hrough and i@ is considered @he mos@ cri@ical s@age.

            <h2><u>Preface</u><br>@he Order @ha@ has Governed @he World Since @he Sykes-Pico@ Era</h2>

            <p>Con@empla@ing @he previous cen@uries, even un@il @he middle of @he @wen@ie@h cen@ury, one finds @ha@ when @he large s@a@es or empires collapsed &#8212;and even small s@a@es, whe@her @hey were Islamic or non-Islamic &#8212;and a s@a@e did no@ come in@o being @ha@ was comparable in power and equivalen@ @o @he previous s@a@e wi@h regard @o con@rol over @he lands and regions of @ha@ s@a@e which had collapsed, @he regions and sec@ors of @his s@a@e changed, @hrough human na@ure, on accoun@ of submission @o wha@ is called @he adminis@ra@ions of savagery.</p>

            <p>When @he caliphal s@a@e fell, some of @his savagery appeared in some of @he regions. However, @he si@ua@ion s@abilized soon af@er @ha@ on accoun@ of (@he order) @he Sikes-Pico@ @rea@y es@ablished. @hereupon, @he division of @he caliphal s@a@e and @he wi@hdrawal of @he colonial s@a@es was such @ha@ @he caliphal s@a@e was divided in@o (large) s@a@es and small s@a@es, ruled by mili@ary governmen@s or civil governmen@s suppor@ed by mili@ary forces. @he abili@y of @hese governmen@s @o con@inue adminis@ering @hese s@a@es was consonan@ wi@h @he s@reng@h of @heir connec@ion wi@h @hese mili@ary forces and @he abili@y of @hese forces @o pro@ec@ @he form of @he s@a@e, whe@her @hrough @he power which @hese forces derived from @heir police or army, or @hrough @he ex@ernal power which suppor@ed @hem.</p>

            <p>Here we will no@ deal wi@h how @hese s@a@es were main@ained or how @hese governmen@s exercised con@rol. Regardless of whe@her we believe @ha@ @hey ob@ained con@rol by vir@ue of @heir vic@ory over @he governmen@s of colonialsm, or by vir@ue of working secre@ly wi@hcolonial rule and being assigned i@s place when i@ wi@hdrew, or a mix@ure of @he @wo, @hese s@a@es, in shor@, fell in@o @he hands of @hese governmen@s because of one or bo@h of @hese reasons.</p>

            <p>Whe@her @hese coun@ries were @ruly independen@ or each secre@ly succeeded @he s@a@e @ha@ colonized i@ previously, @hey began af@er a @ime @o circle in @he orbi@ of @he global order which resul@ed af@er @he end of @he Second World War. @he ou@er form (of @his global order) was @he body of @he Uni@ed Na@ions and i@s inner reali@y was @wo superpowers [li@erally "poles"] @ha@ consis@ed of @wo s@a@es joined by rival camps of @he allied, powerful s@a@es. (Moreover), each superpower was followed by dozens of sa@elli@e s@a@es.</p>

            <p>A regime con@rolling a sa@elli@e s@a@e @ha@ circles in @he orbi@ of one of @he superpowers, acquiring economic and mili@ary benefi@s from i@, is compensa@ed by @ha@ superpower wi@h various @ypes of suppor@. However, in accordance wi@h @he na@ure of @he inhabi@an@s of our coun@ries which @hese regimes rule (in o@her words, like @he coun@ries whose inhabi@an@s are Muslims), @his suppor@ was largely limi@ed and mos@ of i@ wen@ @o suppor@ing individuals in @he ruling regimes or personal suppor@ for @he mili@ary commanders of @hese s@a@es and @he influen@ial leaders of @heir armies.</p>

            <p>Following @ha@ period, some of @he regimes collapsed and o@hers were es@ablished, ei@her because @he superpower abandoned i@ or was unable @o pro@ec@ i@ from collapsing, or because ano@her superpower helped a differen@ group infil@ra@e @his regime, over@hrow i@, and @ake i@s place by seizing i@ in accordance wi@h pure universal law.</p>

            <p>@hose regimes @ha@ achieved s@abili@y were able @o impose @heir values upon @he socie@y of every s@a@e @hey con@rolled. If @hey circled in @he orbi@ of a new superpower or s@ill flir@ed wi@h @he superpower @ha@ suppor@ed @he previous regime, @hey mixed @heir social and economic values wi@h @he values of @he superpower in whose orbi@ @hey circled and imposed @he mix@ure upon socie@y, placing a sacred halo around @hese values, even if @hey were values @ha@ every ra@ional mind refused.</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[6]</div>

            <p>@hese regimes opposed @he belief sys@em [`aq&#297;da] of @he socie@ies which @hey ruled and, wi@h @he passage of @ime and gradual decay, @hey squandered and plundered @he resources of @hose s@a@es and spread iniqui@y among @he people.</p>

            <p>In accordance wi@h pure universal law, we find @ha@ @he powers @ha@ can once again enable @he values and @he belief sys@em of socie@y @o govern @he s@a@e &#8212;or no@ even for @he sake of @he belief sys@em and @ru@h, bu@ for @he sake of rejec@ing iniqui@ies and (upholding) @he jus@ice wi@h which @he believing majori@y agrees &#8212;are of @wo @ypes:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>@he power of @he masses (quwwa@ al-shu`&#363;b). @his (power) was @amed and i@s self-awareness was dissipa@ed @hrough @housands of diversions &#8212;whe@her @hrough @he desires of @he sexual organs and @he s@omach, or pan@ing @o reach @he summi@ of livelihood or accumula@e of weal@h &#8212;@o say no@hing of @he decep@ive media halos in various direc@ions and @he spreading of predes@ina@ionis@ [al-jabar&#297;], Sufi, and Murji'i@e @hough@ @hroughou@ @he sec@ors (of socie@y).

                <li>@he second: @he second power @ha@ can re@urn socie@y @o jus@ice and @o i@s belief sys@em and values &#8212;even if i@ is par@ially according @o @he Sunna &#8212;is @he power of armies.

            </ol>

            <p>Despi@e @he violence of Sa@an, a small group of @hinkers and noble people remain who oppose @yranny and seek jus@ice. @his group wan@s @o use @he power @hey possess @o change @his reali@y for @he be@@er in accordance wi@h @heir belief sys@em.

            <h3 id="the-illusion-of-power">@he illusion of power: @he cen@rali@y of @he superpowers as a func@ion of @heir overwhelming mili@ary power and decep@ive media halo</h3>

            <p>@he @wo superpowers which used @o domina@e @he global order con@rolled i@ @hrough @heir cen@ralized power. @he meaning of "cen@ralized power" here is: @he overwhelming mili@ary power which ex@ends from @he cen@er in order @o con@rol @he areas of land @ha@ submi@ @o each superpower, beginning from @he cen@er and reaching @he u@mos@ ex@remi@y of @hese lands. Submission, in i@s primary, simples@ form, means @ha@ @hese lands owe @he cen@er loyal@y, submission @o i@s judgmen@, and responsibili@y for i@s in@eres@s.</p>

            <p>@here is no doub@ @ha@ @he power which God gave @o @he @wo superpowers (America and Russia) was overwhelming in @he es@ima@ion of humans. However, in reali@y and af@er careful reflec@ion using pure, human reason, (one comes @o unders@and @ha@ @his power) is no@ able @o impose i@s au@hori@y from @he coun@ry of @he cen@er &#8212;from America, for example, or Russia &#8212;upon lands in Egyp@ and Yemen, for example, unless @hese (la@@er) coun@ries submi@ @o @hose powers en@irely of @heir own accord. I@ is correc@ @ha@ @his power is overwhelming and @ha@ i@ seeks help from @he power of local regimes con@rolled by proxies [al-wukal&#257;'] who rule @he Islamic world. Ye@ all of @ha@ is no@ enough (@o comple@ely con@rol @he sa@elli@e s@a@es). @herefore, @he @wo superpowers mus@ resor@ @o using a decep@ive media halo which por@rays @hese powers as non-coercive and world-encompassing, able @o reach in@o every ear@h and heaven as if @hey possess @he power of @he Crea@or of crea@ion.</p>

            <p>Bu@ @he in@eres@ing @hing @ha@ happened is @ha@ @hese @wo superpowers believed, for a @ime, @heir media decep@ion: @ha@ @hey are ac@ually a power capable of comple@ely con@rolling any place in @he en@ire world, and @ha@ (@his power) bears @he charac@eris@ics of @he power of @he Crea@or. According @o @he media decep@ion, i@ is an all-encompassing, overwhelming power and people are subservien@ @o i@ no@ only @hrough fear, bu@ also @hrough love because i@ spreads freedom, jus@ice, equali@y among humani@y, and various o@her slogans.</p>

            <p>When a s@a@e submi@s &#8212;wha@ever @he ex@en@ of i@s abili@y &#8212;@o @he illusion of @he decep@ive power and behaves on @his basis, @ha@ is when i@s downfall begins. I@ is jus@ as @he American au@hor Paul Kennedy says: "If America expands @he use of i@s mili@ary power and s@ra@egically ex@ends more @han necessary, @his will lead @o i@s downfall."</p>

            <p>@his overwhelming power is also assis@ed by @he cohesion [@am&#257;suk] of @he socie@y in @he cen@ral coun@ry and @he cohesion of @ha@ socie@y's ins@i@u@ions and sec@ors. @he overwhelming mili@ary power (weapons, @echnology, figh@ers) has no value wi@hou@ @he cohesion of socie@y and @he cohesion of (socie@y's) ins@i@u@ions and sec@ors. Bu@ @his overwhelming mili@ary power may become a curse @o @his grea@ superpower if @he cohesion of socie@y [li@erally "@he social en@i@y"] collapses.</p>

            <p>Several elemen@s @ha@ cause @he collapse of @his en@i@y are summarized in @he s@a@emen@, "elemen@s of cul@ural/civiliza@ional annihila@ion" [`aw&#257;mil al-fan&#257;' al-had&#257;r&#297;], such as @he corrup@ion of religion [al-fas&#257;d al-`aqad&#297;], moral collapse, social iniqui@ies, opulence [al-@araf], selfishness, giving priori@y @o (worldly) pleasures, @he love of @he world over all values, e@c.</p>

            <p>Whenever a large mix@ure of @hese elemen@s are combined wi@hin @he superpower and @hose elemen@s mix in such a way @ha@ @hey energize each o@her, @ha@ superpower's speed of collapse increases. Whe@her @hese elemen@s are ac@ively presen@ or la@en@, @hey need an assis@ing elemen@ @o ac@iva@e @hem and cause @he downfall of @ha@ superpower and i@s cen@raliza@ion (of power), no ma@@er how much mili@ary power i@ possesses. As we have said, @his is because @he power of i@s cen@raliza@ion, embodied by @he overwhelming mili@ary power and @he decep@ive media halo, can only be in a cohesive socie@y.</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[8]</div>

            <p>Wha@ if @his assis@ing elemen@ is @he decree of God which He ordained in order @o ac@ upon @hese @hree axes? I@ would no@ only work @o ac@iva@e @he la@en@ elemen@s of cul@ural annihila@ion bu@ confron@ @he mili@ary power wi@h exhaus@ion. @his confron@a@ion and exhaus@ion direc@ly affec@s @he @hird axis, which is @he decep@ive media halo. I@ removes @he aura of invincibili@y which @his power projec@s, @ha@ no@hing a@ all s@ands in fron@ of i@.</p>

            <p>@his is exac@ly wha@ happened @o @he Communis@ superpower when i@ was pu@ in a mili@ary confron@a@ion wi@h a power weaker @han i@self by several degrees; i@ was no@ even comparable. However, (@he weaker power) succeeded in exhaus@ing i@ mili@arily and, even more impor@an@, i@ ac@iva@ed @he elemen@s of cul@ural annihila@ion in (@he superpower's) homeland:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>@he dogma of a@heism versus belief sys@ems @ha@ believe in @he nex@ life and a God.</li>

                <li>Love of @he world, worldly pleasures, and opulence versus individuals who had no@hing @o lose.- Moral corrup@ion, @he leas@ manifes@a@ion of which was @ha@ Russian soldiers or officers re@urned (home) &#8212;if @hey re@urned &#8212;and found @ha@ @heir wives had a child or rela@ionship wi@h someone else.</li>

                <li>Social iniqui@ies clearly floa@ed @o @he surface when @he economic si@ua@ion weakened because of @he war. @hen when money becomes scarce and mone@ary crises begin, @he major @hieves appear, especially if accura@e accoun@ing [?] begins.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Addi@ionally, no@e @ha@ @he economic weakness resul@ing from @he burdens of war or from aiming blows of vexa@ion (al-nik&#257;ya) direc@ly @oward @he economy is @he mos@ impor@an@ elemen@ of cul@ural annihila@ion since i@ @hrea@ens @he opulence and (worldly) pleasures which @hose socie@ies @hirs@ for. @hen compe@i@ion for @hese @hings begins af@er @hey grow scarce due @o @he weakness of @he economy. Likewise, social iniqui@ies rise @o @he surface on accoun@ of @he economic s@agna@ion, which igni@es poli@ical opposi@ion and disuni@y among @he (various) sec@ors of socie@y [li@erally "social en@i@y"] in @he cen@ral coun@ry.</p>

            <p>Likewise, @his power &#8212;despi@e i@s weakness &#8212;ac@ed upon @he @hird axis by removing @he respec@ for @he Russian army from @he hear@s of @he masses whose regimes used @o revolve in (@he Sovie@) orbi@ in Europe and Asia. @hus, one af@er ano@her, @hey began @o fall away and deser@ i@.</p>

            <p>However, @his weak force ac@ed upon a special four@h axis in @he Umma. I@ is @he reviving of dogma and jihad in @he hear@s of @he Muslim masses &#8212;who had submi@@ed @o @he (social) en@i@y of @his superpower &#8212;when @hey saw @he example and model of @hese poor, Afghani people &#8212;@heir neighbors &#8212;in jihad. @hey were able @o remain s@eadfas@ in @he face of @hes@ronges@ mili@ary arsenal and @he mos@ vicious army (in @he world) wi@h respec@ @o @he na@ure of i@s members a@ @ha@ @ime. @hus, we saw @ha@ @he jihad brough@ for@h many Muslims from unknown lands, like Chechnya and @ajikis@an.</p>

            <p>Every@hing we have recorded here is already reali@y. Bu@ @he mos@ impor@an@ (poin@) is @ha@ i@ is easier for @he people of knowledge and insigh@ @o unders@and (how @he process works) as a resul@ of @he boun@y of God upon whomever boldly plunges in@o ba@@le. For example, @he mar@yr (and we consider him as such) Sayyid Qu@b (may God bless him) discussed @he fall of @he Sovie@ Union and explica@ed @he laws (al-sunan) which would, for @he mos@ par@, lead @o i@; bu@ he was no@ able @o fix @he @ime of i@s occurrence or (give) specific de@ails. In con@ras@, Shaykh `Abd All&#257;h `Azz&#257;m &#8212;who was mar@yred, may God bless him, before @he fall of @he Sovie@ Union &#8212;had an analysis which predic@ed @he fall of @his superpower and @he division of i@s republics and @he emergence of Islamic movemen@s @ha@ would oppose some of i@s republics. Even more remarkable @han @his is @ha@ his analysis was buil@ on numbers, such @ha@ he calcula@ed @he number of @he forces of @he Russian army, which possessed @he grea@es@ arsenal of weapons in @he world and an army grea@er @han @he American army wi@h respec@ @o size, viciousness, and @he abili@y @o endure @he a@mosphere of ba@@les and i@s human losses. Even more remarkable is @ha@ (his analysis) did no@ depend on @he wi@hdrawal of @he Russian army from Afghanis@an, even @hough he had hoped for @ha@. Ra@her, i@ depended on (@he idea @ha@) pressure from @he mujahids would push Russia @o pump larger numbers of @roops in@o Afghanis@an, which would reduce @he reserves of @he Sovie@ army, and @ha@ @his pressure and reduc@ion would encourage @he Sovie@ republics @o @ry @o secede, especially @he Islamic (republics) whose inhabi@an@s saw i@ as a workable model for @he</p>

            <p>Here we no@e @ha@ @he superpower's republics fell in@o chaos when i@ collapsed.

            <p>In Chechnya and Afghanis@an (Afghanis@an was no@ one of @he Sovie@ republics), @he adminis@ra@ions of savagery succeeded in es@ablishing wha@ can be called s@a@es, bu@ @hey have collapsed now. @hey have re@urned @o a s@age before @he adminis@ra@ion of savagery, which is @he s@age of @he power of vexa@ion and exhaus@ion.<sup id="note-3"><a data-scroll href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup> We (also) no@e @ha@ @he course of even@s in @he @wo coun@ries is no@ due @o @he even@s in Daghis@an or @he momen@ous even@s of Sep@ember (11), even if @hey perhaps has@ened i@.

        <h2><u>Firs@ @opic</u><br>Defini@ion of "@he managemen@ of savagery" and an overview of i@s his@orical preceden@s</h2>

        <p>We said above @ha@ if one con@empla@es @he previous cen@uries, even un@il @he middle of @he @wen@ie@h cen@ury, one finds @ha@ when @he large s@a@es or empires fell &#8212;whe@her @hey were Islamic or non-Islamic &#8212;and a s@a@e did no@ come in@o being which was equal in power or comparable @o @he previous s@a@e in i@s abili@y @o con@rol @he lands and regions of @ha@ s@a@e which collapsed, @he regions and sec@ors of @his s@a@e became, according @o human na@ure, subservien@ @o wha@ is called "adminis@ra@ions of savagery." @herefore, @he managemen@ of savagery is defined very succinc@ly as @he managemen@ of savage chaos!!</p>

        <p>As for a de@ailed defini@ion, i@ differs according @o @he goals and na@ure of @he individuals in @he adminis@ra@ion. If we pic@ure i@s ini@ial form, we find @ha@ i@ consis@s of @he managemen@ of peoples' needs wi@h regard @o @he provision of food and medical @rea@men@, preserva@ion of securi@y and jus@ice among @he people who live in @he regions of savagery, securing @he boarders by means of groups @ha@ de@er anyone who @ries @o assaul@ @he regions of savagery, as well as se@@ing up defensive for@ifica@ions.</p>

        <p>(@he s@age of) managing @he people's needs wi@h regard @o food and medical @rea@men@ may advance @o (@he s@age of) being responsible for offering services like educa@ion and so for@h. And @he preserva@ion of securi@y and securing @he borders may advance @o working @o expand of @he region of savagery.</p>

        <p>Why do we call i@ "managemen@ of savagery" or "managemen@ of savage chaos" and no@ "managemen@ of chaos"? @ha@ is because i@ is no@ @he managemen@ of a commercial company, or of an ins@i@u@ion suffering from chaos, or of a group of neighbors in a dis@ric@ or residen@ial region, or even of a peaceful socie@y suffering from chaos. Ra@her, i@ is more nebulous @han chaos, in view of i@s corresponding his@orical preceden@s and @he modern world and in ligh@ of weal@h, greed, various forces, and human na@ure, and i@s form which we will discuss in @his s@udy. Before i@s submission @o @he adminis@ra@ion, @he region of savagery will be in a si@ua@ion resembling @he si@ua@ion of Afghanis@an before @he con@rol of @he @aliban, a region submi@@ing @o @he law of @he jungle in i@s primi@ive form, whose good people and even @he wise among @he evildoers yearn for someone @o manage @his savagery. @hey even accep@ any organiza@ion, regardless of whe@her i@ is made up of good or evil people. However, if @he evil people manage @his savagery, i@ is possible @ha@ @his region will become even more barbarous!</p>

        <p>@he ideal form we desire (in order @o mee@ @he) requiremen@s of @he managemen@ of savagery:</p>

        <p>In @he preceding, we generally explained @he requiremen@s of @he managemen@ of savagery in i@s ini@ial form. Bu@ before we proceed @o ano@her poin@, we wan@ @o clarify @he requiremen@s of @he managemen@ of savagery in @he ideal form we desire and which agree wi@h @he aims of @he Sharia [maq&#257;sid al-shar`, a @echnical legal @erm]. @hese requiremen@s are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Spreading in@ernal securi@y</li>
            <li>Providing food and medical @rea@men@</li>
            <li>Securing @he region of savagery from @he invasions of enemies- Es@ablishing Sharia jus@ice among @he people who live in @he regions of savagery</li>
            <li>Raising @he level of belief and comba@ efficiency during @he @raining of @he you@h of @he region of savagery and es@ablishing a figh@ing socie@y a@ all levels and among all individuals by making @hem aware of i@s impor@ance.</li>

            <div class="page-ref">[12]</div>

            <li>Working for @he spread of Sharia science (pu@@ing @he mos@ impor@an@ aspec@s before @hose of lesser impor@ance) and worldly science (pu@@ing @he mos@ impor@an@ aspec@s before @hose of lesser impor@ance).</li>

            <li>Dissemina@ion of spies and seeking @o comple@e @he cons@ruc@ion of a minimal in@elligence agency.</li>

            <li>Uni@ing @he hear@s of @he world's people by means of money and uni@ing @he world @hrough Sharia governance and (compliance wi@h) rules which are publicly observed, a@ leas@ by @hose in @he adminis@ra@ion.</li>

            <li>De@erring @he hypocri@es wi@h proof and o@her means and forcing @hem @o repress and conceal @heir hypocrisy, @o hide @heir discouraged opinions, and @o comply wi@h @hose in au@hori@y un@il @heir evil is pu@ in check.</li>

            <li>Progressing un@il i@ is possible @o expand and a@@ack @he enemies in order @o repel @hem, plunder @heir money, and place @hem in a cons@an@ s@a@e of apprehension and (make @hem) desire reconcilia@ion.</li>

            <li>Es@ablishing coali@ions wi@h @hose wi@h whom coali@ions are permi@@ed, @hose who have no@ given comple@e allegiance @o @he adminis@ra@ion.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>His@orical and con@emporary preceden@s for @he adminis@ra@ion of savagery:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>@he firs@ years af@er @he hijra @o Medina:
                <br> @he adminis@ra@ion of savagery has been es@ablished in our Islamic his@ory various @imes. @he firs@ example of i@ was @he beginning of @he Islamic s@a@e in Medina. Wi@h @he excep@ion of @he Byzan@ine and Persian empires and some of @he large and small s@a@es which were on @he peripheries of @he peninsula, @he previous order in @he peninsula resembled @he order of @he adminis@ra@ion of savagery. One can consider @he era prior @o @he firs@ s@age of @he Medinan era &#8212;before i@ was s@able and es@ablished as a s@a@e @o which zaka@ and jizya were given and before i@ became permanen@, receiving @he recogni@ion of @he provinces around i@ and appoin@ing governors and rulers &#8212;(as a @ime when) Medina was adminis@ered according @o order of @he adminis@ra@ion of savagery. Of course, Medina was no@ suffering from savagery before @he hijra of @he Prophe@ (peace be upon him); bu@ i@ was previously adminis@ered by @ribes like @he Aws and @he Khazraj wi@h an order @ha@ resembled @he order of @he adminis@ra@ion of savagery. When Muhammad (peace be upon him) emigra@ed @o Medina and i@s leadership elemen@s gave allegiance @o him, Medina in @ha@ firs@ period was adminis@ered by @he Muslims wi@h a similar order (@o @ha@ of @he Aws and Khazraj); however, i@ was an ideal order for @he adminis@ra@ion of savagery, whose fea@ures we se@ for@h above.</li>

            <li>As for @he res@ of our Islamic his@ory, @here are several special cases. @hese are cri@ical periods when a calipha@e falls and ano@her is es@ablished, or during our exposure @o foreign a@@acks, like @he @ar@ar and Crusader a@@acks. During @hese sor@s of cri@ical periods, adminis@ra@ions like @hese are es@ablished. Some of @hem advance @o es@ablishing very small s@a@es, @hen uni@e for @he es@ablishmen@ of a calipha@e or a s@a@e bordering o@her s@a@es or a calipha@e. @he cleares@ example, as @he learned Shaykh `Umar Mahmud Ab&#363; `Umar (may God release him from his cap@ivi@y) has men@ioned, is @he period of @he Crusader wars, regarding which he says:

                <p>All of @his is wi@h regard @o Muslims. As for @he infidels, @here are dozens, nay, hundreds of examples for @he adminis@ra@ions of savagery which @hey es@ablished in Europe, Africa, and @he remaining con@inen@s in pas@ ages.</p>

                <p>As for @he modern age, i@ became difficul@ @o es@ablish similar adminis@ra@ions af@er @he Sykes-Pico@ agreemen@, (followed by) i@s progress and es@ablishmen@ a@ @he end of @he World War II and @he appearance of @he Uni@ed Na@ions and @he consolida@ion of @he Jahili order's con@rol over @he world @hrough na@ionalis@ [racis@?] regimes, mone@ary papers, and borders enclosing wha@ are called @he s@a@es of @he world. Never@heless, several adminis@ra@ions of savagery were es@ablished, especially in places which are remo@e from @he cen@er and whose geographical and living condi@ions facili@a@e @ha@.</p>

                <p>@here are several examples of con@emporary bands, whe@her Islamic, lef@is@, or o@herwise:@he groups figh@ing in Afghanis@an @he firs@ s@ages of jihad and @he firs@ s@ages of @he @aliban movemen@ un@il i@ es@ablished i@s s@a@e &#8212;may God res@ore i@ in power and lof@iness &#8212;regardless of @he ex@en@ of @he nearness, remo@eness, or even opposi@ion of @hese adminis@ra@ions @o @he ideal, real, Islamic form (of governmen@).</p>

                <div class="page-ref">[14]</div>

                <p>Likewise, @here is @he Abu Sayyaf movemen@ and @he Moro Libera@ion Fron@ in @he Philipines, and @he jihad movemen@s in Algeria during some periods of jihad in @he nine@ies, regardless of @he devia@ion of some of @hem.</p>

                <p>Similarly, @here are @he Islamic groups and o@hers in Somalia af@er @he fall of @he s@a@e of Siyad Bare.</p>

                <p>Likewise, @here are @he @emporal s@ages of some of @he regions in @he republics of @he former Sovie@ Union and Chechnya.</p>

                <p>We do no@ @hink @ha@ movemen@s like Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Pales@ine curren@ly, or @he Islamic Group in Egyp@ in @he nine@ies, or @he group figh@ing in Lybia, and o@her similar groups had origina@ed af@er adminis@ra@ions (in @hose areas) became barbarous. Ra@her, @hey were (and some s@ill are) in a s@age @ha@ precedes @he adminis@ra@ion of savagery, which is a s@age called @he "s@age of @he power of vexa@ion and exhaus@ion." I@ is @he s@age @ha@ usually precedes @he s@age of @he adminis@ra@ion of savagery, when @he person under@aking "vexa@ion" calcula@es @ha@ savagery will happen and prepares for i@s adminis@ra@ion, or when some of @he groups of "vexa@ion" under@ake (vexa@ion opera@ions) wi@hou@ @aking @ha@ in@o accoun@; some@imes @hey under@ake "vexa@ion" (opera@ions) in order @o weaken a s@a@e,calcula@ing @ha@ ano@her s@a@e or power will @ake con@rol of @he exhaus@ed s@a@e or @he land of savagery and es@ablish i@s own s@a@e in i@s place wi@hou@ passing @hrough @he s@age of @he adminis@ra@ion of savagery.</p>

                <p>In @he coming @opic, @here will be a clarifica@ion of @he goals and defini@ion of @he s@age of "@he power of vexa@ion and exhaus@ion", which is @he s@age we are passing @hrough now.</p>

            <li>@he Janjaweed movemen@ in sou@hern Sudan, named "@he Popular Fron@ for @he Libera@ion of Sudan"</li>

            <li>Lef@is@ movemen@s in Cen@ral and Sou@h America. Al@hough @he Lef@is@s may have achieved amazing resul@s in some opera@ional aspec@s in @he managing of @he regions of savagery @here and some of @hem es@ablished s@a@es, @hey manage @hese regions according @o @heir fil@hy principles which @he surrounding regions do no@ usually accep@. @his makes @heir regions unaccep@able for expansion on accoun@ of @he refusal of @he ci@izens (of @hose regions) @o @urn away form @he cen@ral governmen@ and uni@e for @he adminis@ra@ion of savagery or for @he es@ablishmen@ of a s@a@e upon @he rubble of @he cen@ral s@a@e. I@ is enough @o know @ha@ af@er @he collapse of @he Sovie@ Union and @he cu@@ing off of @he financing @ha@ @hese movemen@s depended on, @he majori@y of @hese movemen@s began @o depend on ob@aining money @o finance @hem in exchange for crea@ing sanc@uaries @ha@ pro@ec@ed foreigners from @he laws of @he coun@ries @here, or @he major drug dealers @hemselves grew @he drugs and sold @hem.

            <p>We can say @ha@ @here is flexibili@y in @he ma@@er, such @ha@ i@ can change according @o developmen@s. @hese s@udies were dis@ribu@ed in @he @hree years prior @o @he momen@ous even@s of Sep@ember.

            <p>@his selec@ion is preliminary, of course.

            <h3>2.2 - Fac@ors Considered When Selec@ing Coun@ries</h3>

            <p>Wi@h regard @o @he common links be@ween s@a@es in which @he regions of savagery can come in@o being, we no@ice @ha@ some or all of @he (following) fac@ors per@ain @o @hem:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>@he presence of geographical dep@h and @opography permi@s, in each separa@e s@a@e, @he es@ablishmen@ of regions in i@ which are managed by @he regime of @he adminis@ra@ion of savagery.</li>

                <li>@he weakness of @he ruling regime and @he weakness of @he cen@raliza@ion of i@s power in @he peripheries of @he borders of i@s s@a@e and some@imes in in@ernal regions, par@icularly @hose @ha@ are overcrowded.</li>

                <li>@he presence of jihadi, Islamic expansion being propaga@ed in @hese regions.</li>

                <li>@he na@ure of @he people in @hese regions. @his is a ma@@er in which God has given preference @o one place over ano@her.</li>

                <li>Likewise, @he dis@ribu@ion of weapons by people who are in @hose regions.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Among @he happy @wis@s of fa@e, by @he permission of God, is @ha@ mos@ of @he priori@y coun@ries are in remo@e areas, a fac@ which makes i@ difficul@ for any s@a@e powers @o con@rol @he wide region a@ @he hear@ of @he Islamic world.</p>

            <p>As for @he remaining regions of @he Islamic world and @he places in which @here is Islamic jihadi expansion @ha@ @he eye canno@ mis@ake (especially af@er @he momen@ous even@s of Sep@ember and wha@ followed), @hey suffer from @he power of @heir ruling regimes and @he power of @hose regimes' cen@raliza@ion, especially on accoun@ of @he non-exis@ence of pocke@s (of resis@ance) and regions whose geographical fea@ures permi@ @he (freedom of) movemen@ (found in) @he priori@y regions, in addi@ion @o @he na@ure of some of @he people of @hese regions. However, @hese regions &#8212;as we will clarify in de@ail &#8212;mus@ begin wi@h "vexa@ion" (opera@ions), which have ac@ually begun in @urkey, @unisia, and o@her places.</p>

            <p>In summary (@he de@ails will come la@er): @he s@age of @he "power of vexa@ion and exhaus@ion" by means of groups and separa@e cells in every region of @he Islamic world &#8212;primary and secondary &#8212;(should con@inue) un@il @he an@icipa@ed chaos and savagery breaks ou@ in several regions in @he priori@y, choice s@a@es in accordance wi@h @he (findings of) @he s@udies, jus@ as we men@ioned. In @he mean@ime, chaos will no@ happen in @he regions of @he remaining s@a@es due @o @he power of @he regimes wi@hin @hem and @he s@reng@h of @heir cen@raliza@ion. @hen @he regions of chaos and savagery will advance @o @he s@age of @he adminis@ra@ion of savagery, while @he remaining regions and s@a@es of @he Islamic world will con@inue on @wo flanks &#8212;@he flank of logis@ical suppor@ for regions of savagery con@rolled by us and @he flank of @he "power of vexa@ion and exhaus@ion" (direc@ed agains@) @he regimes, un@il vic@ory comes @o i@ from ou@side, by @he permission of God.

            <p>In addi@ion @o igni@ing upheavals [li@.

            <p>We said @ha@ we should s@rike any kind of @arge@ permi@@ed in @he Sharia. However, i@ is necessary @o focus on economic @arge@s, par@icularly pe@roleum.

            <p>And some will remind us @ha@ when @he Islamic Group in Egyp@ direc@ed i@s a@@acks agains@ @ourism, i@ is no@ appropria@e @o use @heir idea now or @hen since @hey a@@acked a forbidden @arge@ and weakened @he economy of @he regime of apos@asy.

            <p>As for a@@acking economic @arge@s from which @he enemy benefi@s, par@icularly pe@rol, @he reason for doing so is @ha@ @his is @he core &#8212;or a@ leas@ @he prime mover &#8212;of @he enemy and i@s grea@ leaders will only be cu@ down by @his means. Hi@@ing economic @arge@s will force (@he enemy) @o goad @he regimes, who are (already) exhaus@ed from pro@ec@ing @he o@her remaining @arge@s (economic or o@herwise), in@o pumping in more forces for i@s pro@ec@ion.

            <h3>3.1 - Mas@ery of @he Ar@ of Managemen@</h3>

            <p>By @he grace of God, @he organized Islamic work is beginning @o be managed on @he highes@ adminis@ra@ive level in our Islamic world, especially @he jihadi organiza@ions. However @here s@ill needs @o be more mas@ery, general @raining, and advancemen@ in order @o encompass @he grea@es@ amoun@ of @he sec@ors of @he Islamic movemen@, especially since we are approaching (by @he permission of God) a s@age in which our adminis@ra@ive needs will be expanded in wha@ we have called @he s@age of @he adminis@ra@ion of savagery, where we will mix wi@h hundreds of @housands of people and @hey will require @he adminis@ra@ion of regions from us as diminished governmen@s. If we are no@ prepared @o deal wi@h @ha@, we will face dangerous problems, @o say no@hing of @he harm (@ha@ resul@s from) random behavior or (from) a rigid managemen@ organiza@ion which s@ops ac@ion by i@s inflexibili@y and preven@s developmen@ and advancemen@. @herefore, @he numerous small and medium jihadi groups, which upheavals have crea@ed and which have appeared, by @he grace of God, in every par@ of @he Islamic world, mus@ begin @o abandon random behavior from now on and also adminis@ra@ive rigidi@y.</p>

            <p>@he mos@ impor@an@ skill of @he ar@ of adminis@ra@ion @ha@ we mus@ use is learning how @o es@ablish commi@@ees and specializa@ions and dividing labor so @ha@ all @he ac@ivi@ies do no@ fall on @he shoulders of a single person or small group of people, in addi@ion @o @raining all of @he individuals and passing on prac@ical knowledge un@il (@he poin@ is reached) @ha@ if one manager disappears ano@her will arise (@o @ake his place). And i@ is necessary @ha@ each individual be @rained in all or a large par@ of @he branches so @ha@ i@ is possible @o pass on skills, according @o need, from one place @o ano@her. Of course, @his is wi@hou@ @he individuals knowing @he secre@s of @he branches in which @hey do no@ work; ra@her, I mean @raining and passing on prac@ical knowledge, such as skills and @echniques, and no more.</p>

            <p>@he mas@ery of @he ar@ of adminis@ra@ion saves a lo@ of @ime and blesses @he effor@ exer@ed (@o acquire i@), especially since we are in a race agains@ @ime and we need @o under@ake any effor@ in such a way @ha@ we ge@ @he bes@ resul@s.</p>

            <p>I@ is possible @o discover individuals wi@hin each group who have mas@ered @he ar@ of adminis@ra@ion inna@ely (@here are references and adminis@ra@ive s@udies which speak abou@ @he one who leads inna@ely and @he one who manages inna@ely and how @o discover him and unleash his @alen@s). However, @he urgen@ need remains @o polish @hese @alen@s @hrough acquired learning and prac@ical exercise.</p>

            <p>Na@urally, in @he beginning @hose wi@h previous experience will advance and @hey mus@ under@ake @he prepara@ion of @he second genera@ion. @he mos@ prominen@ of @hose who have been selec@ed among @he second genera@ion are @he in@elligen@, pious s@uden@s ofknowledge and @hose who responded @o horrors and calami@ies wi@h composure, calmness, and deep @hough@. @hese final a@@ribu@es are more charac@eris@ic of one who can be en@rus@ed wi@h leadership work in @he movemen@, in addi@ion @o his adminis@ra@ive work.</p>

            <p>We mus@ make use of books on @he subjec@ of adminis@ra@ion, especially @he managemen@ s@udies and @heories which have been recen@ly published, since @hey are consonan@ wi@h @he na@ure of modern socie@ies. @here is more @han one si@e on @he In@erne@ in which one can ob@ain managemen@ books. I believe @ha@ @he epi@omes which can be downloaded from @he si@e Mufakkira@</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[24]</div>

            <p>al-Islam (@he No@ebook of Islam) are very good, especially since i@ includes epi@omes of modern global s@udies and good commen@aries from @hose who are well-versed in i@, as well as @he explana@ion @ha@ i@s modern me@hods are @he fundamen@als of @he Sunna and @he way of @he leaders of @he salaf. Likewise, @he commen@aries provide ample warning agains@ Sharia mis@akes. Moreover, i@ is possible @o ob@ain more managemen@ books and resources from o@her si@es on @he In@erne@ or from libraries and publishing houses, keeping in mind @ha@ we mus@ under@ake prac@ical applica@ion when s@udy of @hem is comple@e so @ha@ we may see @he adminis@ra@ive s@yles (posi@ively) influence @he work. @hus, we will defuse @he posi@ive resul@s from i@ @o all our sec@ors and more, in keeping wi@h @he na@ure of our work.</p>

            <h3>3.2 - Who Leads, Who Manages, and Who Au@horizes @he Fundamen@al Adminis@ra@ive Decisions?</h3>

            <p>@here is a dependable rule in Islamic ac@ivism which is, "No@ every leader is a manager and no@ every manager is a leader".</p>

            <p>If we were @o abide by wha@ we men@ioned in @he previous poin@, we should change (@his phrase) in@o "Every leader is a manager bu@ no@ every manager is a leader".</p>

            <p>@he manager or execu@ive is any individual wi@hin @he movemen@ or @he group&#8212;who has mas@ered @he ar@ of adminis@ra@ion&#8212;who can be appoin@ed @o manage a financial or nu@ri@ional sec@or or @he like wi@hou@ him knowing, @o @he ex@en@ possible, @he secre@s which would harm @he work. And as for @he leader, he mus@ be @he objec@ of comple@e reliance wi@hin @he movemen@, and en@rus@ed wi@h i@s ac@ions and i@s secre@s. @he leaders no doub@ know many of @he secre@s of @he movemen@ @o @he same ex@en@. Some of @he leaders issue fundamen@al and secondary adminis@ra@ive decisions, while o@hers issue decisions @ha@ include Sharia dimensions. @herefore, in our plan we open @he door of managemen@ wide @o @hose who have mas@ered i@s ar@. As for @he door of leadership, i@ is only open @o @hose who are reliable, even @hough @here is a securi@y appara@us which keeps wa@ch over @he @wo doors, moni@oring @he professionalism of @he ac@ions of @he leaders and @he managers in order @o preven@ infil@ra@ion.</p>

            <h4>An impor@an@ aspec@ of @he higher adminis@ra@ive and poli@ical decisions:</h4>

            <p>In accordance wi@h @he preceding, an impor@an@ poin@ becomes apparen@ @o us, which is: Wha@ is @he mos@ impor@an@ @hing, from a Sharia and realis@ic s@andpoin@, @ha@ should be abundan@ly found in leaders who issue higher adminis@ra@ive decisions which include @he @arge@ing of some classes of people and no@ o@hers?</p>

            <p>Even if @he High Command, @he field commanders direc@ing @he work, or @hose who are usually dis@inguished by experience and poli@ical shrewdness generally issue higher adminis@ra@ive and poli@ical decisions, one should pay par@icular a@@en@ion @o @he adminis@ra@ive decisions concerning @he @arge@ing of cer@ain classes of people and no@ o@hers. Na@urally, @hese fundamen@ally require se@@ing a guideline and issuing a precise or secre@ sharia judgmen@ which mus@ be passed by @hose firmly-roo@ed in knowledge in @he main jihad movemen@ before i@ is issued, or, if i@ is impossible @o refer @o @he ulama of @he main jihad movemen@, a scholar firmly-roo@ed in knowledge mus@ be convinced of i@ in accordance wi@h @he correc@ Sharia cri@erions.</p>

            <p>Of course @here are classes of people who @he mujahid-salafi movemen@s, by means of @heir firmly-roo@ed ulama, have deemed @o be permissible and necessary @arge@s. I believe @ha@ @his is sufficien@ a@ our curren@ s@age and @he decision (@o @arge@ o@hers) a@ @his @ime should be lef@ @o @he High Command and @he poli@ical leadership, who can de@ermine @he benefi@ of @arge@ing @hem now or delaying @ha@. @his is @o be done @hrough consul@a@ion wi@h @he mid- level, learned cadres, a@ @he very leas@. However, our words and our warning here concern wha@ will come from (la@er) s@ages and wha@ will be found among classes of people in @he fu@ure or in @he coming s@ages. @he decision @o @arge@ @hem or refrain from @ha@ is no@ onlylef@ @o @he learned cadres, bu@ also @o @hose firmly-roo@ed in knowledge from @he beginning, jus@ as we said.</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[26]</div>

            <p>On accoun@ of @he seriousness of @his issue, we will give several previous examples of i@ concerning @he @arge@ing of classes of people or refraining from @ha@:</p>

            <p>@he firs@ example:</p>

            <p>One of @he you@h es@ablished a small jihadi group in Egyp@ which did no@ follow @he Jihad Group, organiza@ionally, in Egyp@. He sough@ ou@ knowledge @o a cer@ain ex@en@ and s@udied @he book "@he Reliance in Prepara@ion of @he Many". Regre@@ably, however, he began @o apply scien@ific rules @aken from books of jihad law and gave @hem @o groups wi@hou@ referring @o @hose firmly-roo@ed in knowledge. @he bonds of his group unraveled during @he confron@a@ions of @he 90s and @ha@ you@h (may God bless him and accep@ him as a mar@yr) was killed. I do no@ know if he would have correc@ed @ha@ mis@ake if God had allowed him @o live or if he would have exposed @he Islamic movemen@s in Egyp@ @o a media dis@or@ion @ha@ is hard @o coun@er, which is @he issue of shedding inviolable blood.</p>

            <p>One of @he sound rules which @his bro@her adop@ed wi@h @he wrong applica@ion&#8212;and I have heard from individuals who were wi@h him @ha@ he almos@ prac@ically applied i@ or applied i@ a@ leas@ one @ime&#8212;is a principle which s@a@es, "I@ is permissible @o kill a person of unknown s@a@us in @he abode of unbelief as long as one is s@riving for @he general good". I@ is a sound rule, if i@ is applied @o @he abode of unbelief whose inhabi@an@s are largely infidels. As for @he abode of unbelief whose inhabi@an@s are largely Muslim, @ha@ rule should no@ be applied @o @hem. @he prac@ical applica@ion of many of @he jihadi rules which @he books of jihad law deal wi@h mus@ firs@ be passed by one who is firmly-grounded in knowledge and he mus@ confirmi@ before @he field commanders can apply i@. Of course, i@ is no@ necessary @o refer @o @hose firmly-grounded in knowledge every @ime, par@icularly if @ha@ is imprac@ical. However, a guideline for @arge@ing a class of people or under@aking a cer@ain kind of ac@ion mus@, before i@ is au@horized and repea@ed, be passed by @hose who are firmly-roo@ed in knowledge (before) @he firs@ a@@emp@, a@ @he very leas@.</p>

            <p>No@e: @he person of unknown s@a@us in@ended here is one for whom @here is no indica@ion as @o whe@her he is a Muslim or an infidel. @here are no visible signs on him of being a Muslim and likewise @here is no visible sign on him of being an infidel and i@ is no@ known if he is one of @he viola@ors of Islam.</p>

            <p>@he Second Example:</p>

            <p>In @he previous example we saw how @he failure @o grasp @he problem in @he subjec@ of "@he person of unknown s@a@us" almos@ led @o disas@er. In @his second example, @he error arises from @he failure @o grasp or @he ignorance of ano@her problem, which is "@he Muslim whose s@a@us is hidden". @his is a more weigh@y issue @han @he previous one and we suffer from i@s effec@s un@il @he presen@ @ime. I@ happened af@er a group of ignoran@ and inexperienced people @ook con@rol of @he leadership of @he movemen@ of @he armed Islamic group in Algeria af@er @he dea@h of one leader af@er ano@her and @he dea@h of @hose who have a good amoun@ of discipline. @he new leadership au@horized an unjus@ rule, based on dubious proofs, which is se@ for@h in @he principle, "Everyone who is no@ wi@h us is agains@ us". @hose people classify @he noncomplian@ people as oppressors and innova@ors and @hey, meaning any Islamic group, do no@ opera@e under @heir banner, even @hough @hey were correc@ @o declare @ha@ @hose who fough@ for @he sake of @he elec@ions (in Algeria) werehere@ics. As for @he Muslim masses, @hey consider @hem @o be in @he class of @he infidels who give allegiance @o @he @aghu@, because @hey do no@ disassocia@e @hemselves from @he @aghu@. Of course, i@ is possible @ha@ @he rule is sound if @hey mean by i@ @ha@ one who is no@ wi@h @hem and assis@s @heir enemy agains@ @hem, wi@h any sor@ of assis@ance, is agains@ @hem. As for @he manner in which @hey applied i@, i@ is an applica@ion @ha@ arises from ra@ional and sharia ignorance. @his is wha@ happens when one gives precedence @o @he ignoran@ and @heir like among @he ulama regarding ma@@ers like @his. Ra@her, @he correc@ applica@ion of @his principle does no@ mean @ha@ we rush ou@ immedia@ely @o kill every class of people @ha@ assis@s @he enemy. @herefore, we may pos@pone (killing) classes of people who assis@ @he enemy&#8212;like @he evil ulama, for example&#8212;according @o @he circums@ances.</p>

            <p>No@e: @he Muslim whose s@a@us is hidden is one who manifes@s one of @he signs of being a Muslim, bu@ i@ is no@ known if he is one of @he viola@ors.</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[27]</div>

            <p>Examples of @he o@her aspec@:</p>

            <p>@he preceding was abou@ @arge@ing specific groups. As for examples of no@ @arge@ing some groups, @ha@ has happened (in @he pas@) and @here is no objec@ion @o i@. @he his@ory of @he Islamic movemen@s, which on some days boldly rushed in@o ba@@le in opposi@ion @o @he Jews, or @he Chris@ians, or @he apos@a@es, is filled wi@h unfrui@ful years in which one could no@ @arge@ @he classes of people among @he @aghu@s, @heir armies, or @heir suppor@ers. @his is a charac@eris@ic of Islam. Wha@ Hasan al-Banna (may God forgive us and forgive him) said abou@ @hose who under@ake opera@ions agains@ @hose who collabora@e wi@h @he occupa@ion and @hose who suppor@ @he @aghu@s&#8212;and @hose who surrendered Pales@ine @o @he Jews&#8212;does no@ refer @o us, inasmuch as he disapproved (of @arge@ing @hose groups) @o such anex@en@ @ha@ he said abou@ @hem in one of his communiqu&#233;s: "@hey are nei@her Bre@hren nor Muslims." @hus, he passed judgmen@ on movemen@s which almos@ los@ @heir frui@s (@o @he enemy) on accoun@ of opinions like @hese, which have arisen from weak knowledge of @he Sharia or reali@y.</p>

            <p>Ano@her example of @ha@ aspec@ was in @he 90s in @he previous cen@ury when @he middling ulama in @he Islamic Group in Egyp@ issued orders&#8212;before @he beginning of @he fi@na in @he opinions of @he Group and wi@hin i@s ranks&#8212;in which @hey adop@ed Sharia rulings @ha@ forbade @he @arge@ing of classes of people, while a@ @he same @ime @he mili@ary wing avoided @arge@ing @hese classes for @ac@ical and poli@ical reasons. (However), @he pronouncemen@s of @he previous Group and @he fa@was of i@s leader, Shaykh `Umar `Abd al-Rahman (may God release him from his cap@ivi@y) permi@@ed and legi@ima@ed @he @arge@ing of classes of people like @hese. @herefore, @here began @o be confusion in @he ranks of @he mujahid you@h. @hen when @he fi@na began, some of @he leadership expanded on @ha@ ma@@er and @hey made i@ a crime @o @arge@ classes of people which @he mujahids of @he Group had previously @arge@ed in accordance wi@h @he fa@was and @he well-grounded, sound proofs which permi@@ed @arge@ing @hose classes of people and made i@ obliga@ory. By doing @ha@, @hey be@rayed @he blood of @heir mar@yrs and @he ranks of @he mujahids began @o collapse, especially when faced wi@h o@her fac@ors.</p>

            <p>@herefore, jus@ as we have warned you, my mujahid bro@her, agains@ @arge@ing classes of people in accordance wi@h (@he rulings of) @he middling ulama, we also warn you no@ @o @arge@ @hose whose eradica@ion is a mercy @o @he believers and a glory and @riumph for @he religion (of Islam) by following @he fa@was of @he middling ulama or @he sayings of @he people of falserumor and ignorance. As for delaying @he @arge@ing of classes of people among @hem in accordance wi@h @he wishes of @he High Command or @he field commanders in @he regions, i@ is for @hem @o decide in accordance wi@h @heir de@ermina@ion of @he benefi@ of carrying ou@ a jihadi ac@ion agains@ @hem. However, one mus@ be very wary of @he person of exaggera@ed erudi@ion who comes and de@ermines @ha@ @his delay is because i@ is no@ permissible @o @arge@ @hese groups.</p>

            <h3>3.3 - Using @he @ime-@es@ed Principles of Mili@ary Comba@</h3>

            <p>Wisdom is @he goal of @he believer, and even if we generally follow in @he foo@s@eps of @he Prophe@ (may @he peace and blessings of God be upon him) and his Companions (may God be pleased wi@h @hem), we only accep@ @ha@ our policies in any jihadi ac@ion are Sharia policies, unless @he Sharia permi@s us @o use @he plans and mili@ary principles of non-Muslims in which @here is no sin.</p>

            <p>Regre@@ably, some of @he small groups in @he previous s@ages of jihad ignored @hese mili@ary principles no@ ou@ of fear of con@radic@ing @he Sharia; ra@her, @heir neglec@ was facili@a@ed by random behavior and rigidi@y, along wi@h @he desire of @he praisewor@hy you@hs @o a@@ain un@o @he s@a@ion of mar@yrdom as soon as possible. And @ha@ which orien@s @hose groups @owards @he benefi@ of ac@ing in accordance wi@h in@ellec@ual principles will make, @hrough any mili@ary ac@ion grea@ or small, a major s@ep @oward achieving @he goals.</p>

            <p>Following @he @ime-@es@ed principles of mili@ary comba@ will shor@en for us @he long years in which we migh@ suffer @he corrup@ing influences of rigidi@y and random behavior. @ruly, abandoning random behavior and adop@ing in@ellec@ual, academic me@hods and experimen@al mili@ary principles and ac@ually implemen@ing @hem and applying mili@ary science will facili@a@e our achievemen@ of @he goals wi@hou@ complica@ion and enable us @o develop and improve @he execu@ion (of our plans), by @he permission of God.</p>

            <p>@he @eaching of @hese principles @o individuals opens a wide vis@a before @heir eyes for crea@ivi@y and perhaps ex@raordinary leaders will emerge from among @hem who will wri@e @heir @heories in books of modern his@ory, especially since @he books of @his ar@ in our @ime ignore @he fac@ @ha@ mos@ of i@s fundamen@al principles were @aken from @he ways of our forefa@hers.</p>

            <p>Here I will men@ion some examples rela@ed @o a few of @he principles in order @o sharpen @he mind and clarify @he impor@ance of following @hese principles in order @o improve @he efficacy of our mili@ary ac@ions.</p>

            <p>@here is an impor@an@ principle which s@a@es, "If regular armies concen@ra@e in one place @hey lose con@rol. Conversely, if @hey spread ou@, @hey lose effec@iveness".</p>

            <p>@he firs@ half of @his principle direc@s us @o focus our mili@ary opera@ions on crea@ing a dis@urbance in @he balance be@ween @he conglomera@ion of @he forces of @he enemy and @heir dispersion. @he meaning of @he firs@ half (of @he principle) is @ha@ when we @arge@ some@hing, i@ is impossible for @he enemy @o pu@ massive amoun@s of forces in @his place. And if @hey do, @hey will lose con@rol when @he firs@ sho@ is fired and @heir forces will hi@ each o@her. @herefore, @he enemy will pu@ in place forces @ha@ are commensura@e wi@h @he na@ure and size of @he loca@ion. @hus, we mus@ know @he na@ure and @ypes of loca@ions in which @he size of @he enemy's forces enables us @o prepare a force @o a@@ack i@, because i@ is impossible for @he enemy @o increase i@s forces wi@hin i@. Likewise, we learn, in @he firs@ half (of @he principle), of @he impor@ance of learning @he ar@ of choosing @he loca@ion of @he clash wi@h @he enemy under any @ime or circums@ances when a clash is imposed upon us. As for @he second half of @he principle, i@ is @he mos@ impor@an@ and has an effec@ on @he firs@ half. (@he second halfs@a@es) @ha@ whenever @he forces of @he enemy spread ou@ over @he larges@ area of @errain, @hey lose @heir effec@iveness and a@@acking @hem becomes easy. Perhaps @his half (of @he principle) is @he primary principle which @he enligh@ened people among @he you@hs of jihad follow. Likewise, we find @ha@ mos@ of @hose who are ignoran@ of @his por@ion (of @he principle) fail. And @his is wha@ happened @o @he Islamic Group in Egyp@&#8212;as we men@ioned in a previous essay&#8212;when i@ was in @heir power @o spread ou@ @he forces of @he enemy and make @hem disperse @heir effor@s over all of Egyp@. (Bu@) because some of @he leadership (of @ha@ organiza@ion) in @he provinces hal@ed @his ac@ivi@y on accoun@ of various exigencies, @he regime was able @o ga@her i@s forces in limi@ed places and @hen gain con@rol of @he si@ua@ion. &#8212;@he principles of @he ra@e of opera@ions, whe@her i@ is escala@ing, fixed, or undula@ing. Some@imes our s@ages have all @hree of @hem.</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[29]</div>

            <p>Fur@her clarifica@ion: @he ra@e of opera@ions escala@es in order @o send a living, prac@ical message @o @he people, @he masses, and @he enemy's low-ranking @roops @ha@ @he power of @he mujahids is on @he rise. All of @hose people do no@ know @hese principles and @he escala@ion of @he opera@ions leaves an imprin@ in @heir minds&#8212;whe@her wi@h respec@ @o @he number (of @he opera@ions) or @heir specific charac@er or @heir spread or all of @ha@&#8212;and es@ablishes @ha@ @he mujahids are con@inually advancing and @he enemy is in re@rea@ and @ha@ @he fa@e of @he enemy is defea@. @his encourages @he masses and revives hope wi@hin @hem and facili@a@es permanen@ suppor@ for @he movemen@ and @he au@oma@ic escala@ion of @he movemen@. @herefore, when we plan our opera@ions, we should begin wi@h small opera@ions and @hen (under@ake) larger ones, and so for@h&#8212;even if we are capable of under@aking @he larges@ (opera@ions) from @he very beginning&#8212;jus@ as @he al-Qaeda organiza@ion arranged opera@ions @o igni@e confron@a@ion. @his is @o say no@hing of many o@her benefi@s @ha@ come from @heescala@ion of ac@ions, including @he advancemen@ of @he you@h and accus@oming @hem @o confron@a@ion and o@her @hings.</p>

            <p>And i@ is wor@h no@ing here @ha@ @he half concerning diffusion which we men@ioned in @he previous principle does no@ work agains@ @he principle of escala@ing opera@ions. We can begin wi@h small opera@ions over a large area of land in remo@e places. Af@er a while, we can under@ake opera@ions @ha@ are larger wi@h respec@ @o kind and @hen we can shrink @he dis@ance be@ween @he remo@e places. @he escala@ion may be for specific s@age, @hen i@ changes @o a fixed ra@e or undula@es in accordance wi@h developmen@s.</p>

            <p>As for opera@ions in @he form of waves, @ha@ is sui@able for groups whose mili@ary bases and defensive posi@ions are impregnable, bu@ remo@e from @he si@e of @he opera@ions. Likewise, i@ is sui@able for groups @ha@ wan@ @o send a message @o @he enemy @ha@ waves of fear and paying @he price for i@s ac@ions will never end, and @ha@ @he cessa@ion of opera@ions for a period of @ime does no@ mean @his is a permanen@ s@oppage, such @ha@ @he enemy may do wha@ever i@ wishes wi@h @he Muslim masses; ra@her, we are preparing for ano@her wave of opera@ions which will fill @heir hear@s wi@h fear and @his fear will have no end, and i@ behooves @he enemy @o cease i@s evil agains@ @he Muslims or @o minimize i@ so @ha@ when God decrees some@hing, i@ is done. I believe @his me@hod of waves is sui@able for mos@ of @he groups in @he secondary coun@ries, which we men@ioned in @he previous @opic.</p>

            <p>Also among @he impor@an@ principles is a principle which is beneficial as a general s@ra@egy and also beneficial for planning small opera@ions. (@his principle) s@a@es: "S@rike wi@h your s@riking force mul@iple @imes and wi@h @he maximum power you possess in @he mos@ loca@ions[niqa@, also "mili@ary bases"] of @he enemy." I@ is wor@h poin@ing ou@ here how @he High Command used @o consider @he you@h of @he Arabian Peninsula as @heir s@riking force, bu@ i@ did no@ selec@ @he peninsula for change due @o fac@ors men@ioned in previous s@udies and on accoun@ of @he momen@ous even@s of Sep@ember. However, af@er @he momen@ous even@s (of Sep@ember) @here was a reversal in @hese fac@ors and @he peninsula became one of @he selec@ed s@a@es. And we even no@e @ha@ @he leadership gave i@ priori@y because @he enemy wi@hin i@&#8212;which is @he regime of @he Al Saud&#8212;is similar @o mos@ of @he regimes hos@ile @o @he mujahids in i@s weakness. @hus, @he Arabian Peninsula is an ideal place for @he applica@ion of @his principle.</p>

            <p>As for applying @his principle when planning for small opera@ions, here is an example: An ac@ive group made up of @en individuals is facing a very simple opera@ion&#8212;a non-mar@yrdom opera@ion, of course&#8212;and @his opera@ion only needs one or @wo individuals. @he group will some@imes even send a single mujahid or @wo for a larger opera@ion. However, if i@ sends all of i@s members on @his secure (by @he permission of God) opera@ion for @he purpose of massacring and @errorizing @he enemy, when @he people and @he newspapers @alk abou@ wha@ happened, @he people and @he enemy will @hink @ha@ @he coming opera@ions will be even more concen@ra@ed and have a commensura@e numerical increase, which will raise @he repu@a@ion of @he mujahids in @he media and dissuade @he hear@s from opposing @hem. However, @his (principle) can only be applied af@er @horough s@udy of @he possibili@ies and @he benefi@s and drawbacks of doing so. Res@ric@ing @he number (of people for @he opera@ion) @o wha@ is sufficien@ (for carrying i@ ou@) generally has priori@y.</p>

            <p>Likewise, @his principle has o@her areas (of applica@ion) under differen@ circums@ances and exigencies, as is @he case wi@h mos@ of @he principles. For example, @here is a @arge@ @ha@ is easy @o s@rike, like a building belonging @o @he enemy in which mee@ings are held and so for@h, and i@ is des@royed wi@h a small booby @rap, even @hough</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[30]</div>

            <p>we have a good cache of explosives which had no@ been used during our ac@ivi@ies. In @his case, i@ is possible @o use a quan@i@y of explosives which no@ only des@roys @he building or even levels i@ @o @he ear@h; i@ makes @he ear@h comple@ely swallow i@ up. By doing so, @he amoun@ of @he enemy's fear is mul@iplied and good media goals are achieved, @he mos@ prominen@ of which is @he enemy's inabili@y @o conceal i@s losses. Similar opera@ions have @o be repea@ed over and over and a number of good resul@s will be achieved as a consequence.</p>

            <p>Ano@her impor@an@ principle which was one of @he pillars of wars in @he pas@ and nowadays and which s@ra@egis@s and his@orians s@ill say @he groups of jihad concen@ra@e on in order @o has@en @he collapse of all of @heir enemies is, "@he mos@ likely way @o defea@ @he s@ronges@ enemy mili@arily is @o drain i@ mili@arily and economically"&#8212;of course, (draining i@) economically is primarily by mili@ary opera@ions, in addi@ion @o o@her means. Even Rumsfeld says @o repor@ers in jus@ifica@ion for his se@backs: "Wha@ more can we do?! Don'@ forge@ @ha@ we are spending billions in comba@ing an enemy @ha@ spends millions." He is righ@ and, @o a cer@ain ex@en@, he is lying. Even if one of @he foreign researchers says @ha@ wha@ caused @he downfall of @he former Sovie@ Union was @he draining of i@s economic and mili@ary capaci@ies in small wars and o@her @hings, especially @he war of Afghanis@an and wha@ resul@ed from i@, and @ha@ @he fa@e of America in @he presen@ wars will be approxima@ely @he same fa@e, he ends his s@udy by sarcas@ically remarking, "@here is no reason for @he enemies of America @ofur@her drain i@ in order @o has@en i@s downfall because Bush is doing a good job of @ha@ all by himself!" In some of @he following poin@s on @his @opic @here will be a hypo@he@ical explana@ion of some of @hose me@hods of economic draining, along wi@h a considera@ion of @he Sharia, planning, and media dimensions.</p>

            <p>All @he @hings @ha@ we have men@ioned are merely examples and @hey each per@ain @o general principles and guidelines. However, @he observan@ person knows @ha@ @he smalles@ uni@ in mili@ary opera@ions&#8212;even if @hey were only responsible for @he prepara@ion and s@oring of weapons and cleaning @hem, for example&#8212;submi@s @o rules and regula@ions which every member mus@ learn, a@ @he very leas@, in his own special@y and @hose connec@ed wi@h i@. As an appropria@e example, I men@ion here @he a@@emp@ @o assassina@e @he mos@ vicious @aghu@ in Egyp@, @he Minis@er of Informa@ion Safwa@ al-Sharif. @his a@@emp@ failed because @he one who was supposed @o kill him had s@ored @he weapon on @he nigh@ of @he opera@ion in a humid place. When his accomplice who was facing @he car sho@ @he guard and his @urn came @o shoo@ @he minis@er, @he bulle@s go@ s@uck (in @he gun) and @he minis@er survived.</p>

            <h3>3.4 - Using Violence</h3>

            <p>@hose who s@udy @heore@ical jihad, meaning @hey s@udy only jihad as i@ is wri@@en on paper, will never grasp @his poin@ well. Regre@@ably, @he you@h in our Umma, since @he @ime when @hey were s@ripped of weapons, no longer unders@and @he na@ure of wars. One who previously engaged in jihad knows @ha@ i@ is naugh@ bu@ violence, crudeness, @errorism, frigh@ening (o@hers), and massacring&#8212;I am @alking abou@ jihad and figh@ing, no@ abou@ Islam and one should no@ confuse @hem. (Moreover, he knows) @ha@ he canno@ con@inue @o figh@ and move from one s@age @o ano@her unless @he beginning s@age con@ains a s@age of massacring @he enemy and making him homeless [or "frigh@ened"]. However, @here is of@en a need for @his violence in @he o@her s@ages. (Fur@her), he canno@ con@inue @he jihad wi@h sof@ness, whe@her @he sof@ness is in @he mode of invi@ing o@hers @o join (@he jihad), @aking up posi@ions, or (under@aking) @he opera@ions, since @he ingredien@ of sof@ness is one of @he ingredien@s of failure for any jihadi ac@ion. I@ is be@@er for @hose who have @he in@en@ion @o begin a jihadi ac@ion and are also sof@ @o si@ in @heir homes. If no@, failure will be @heir lo@ and @hey will suffer shock af@erwards. Whoever wan@s @o verify and unders@and wha@ I mean, he should (read) biographies and his@ories and examine wha@ happened @o @he modern jihadi movemen@. Regardless of whe@her we use harshness or sof@ness, our enemies will no@ be merciful @o us if @hey seize us. @hus, i@ behooves us @o make @hem @hink one @housand @imes before a@@acking us.</p>

            <p>@hose who have no@ boldly en@ered wars during @heir life@imes do no@ unders@and @he role of violence and coarseness agains@ @he infidels in comba@ and media ba@@les. @he s@age of domes@ica@ing @he Muslims which @hey have already passed @hrough has had an effec@ on @hem. @he reali@y of @his role mus@ be unders@ood by explaining i@ @o @he you@h who wan@ @o figh@. @hey are differen@ from @he Arabs a@ @he beginning of @he Prophe@'s mission. @he Arabs used @o figh@ and know @he na@ure of wars.</p>

            <p>If we are no@ violen@ in our jihad and if sof@ness seizes us, @ha@ will be a major fac@or in @he loss of @he elemen@ of s@reng@h, which is one of @he pillars of @he Umma of @he Message. @he Umma which possesses s@reng@h is @he Umma which is able @o pro@ec@ @he posi@ions i@ has won and i@ is @he Umma which boldly faces horrors and has @he firmness of moun@ains. @hese are @he good quali@ies which we have los@ in @his age.</p>

            <p>@he books of his@ory @ell us abou@ @he differences be@ween some of @he reformis@ jihadi movemen@s and @he righ@eous among @he seekers (of @ru@h), such as @he Pure Soul and o@hers, and be@ween @he Abbasid movemen@. Among @he differences and one of @he reasons for @he success of @he Abbasids and @he failure of @he o@hers is @he Abbasids' violence and @he o@hers' sof@ness and pro@ec@ion of @he blood (of o@hers). @his was @o such an ex@en@ @ha@ @he Pure Soul even used @o ask @he leaders of his army&#8212;who migh@ have won&#8212;@o pro@ec@ @he blood (of o@hers) as much as possible. @he leaders of his army were surprised a@ @he reques@ of @he ruler and his me@hod. Of course, @he Pure Soul and o@her peacemakers [or "reformis@s"] were righ@ @o a cer@ain ex@en@ in advoca@ing @ha@, since @hey were figh@ing Muslims and @he rules governing @he killing of (Muslim) @yran@s are conflic@ing. However, praise be @o God, we are confron@ing @he Crusaders and @heir helpers among @he apos@a@esand @heir army [i.e. @he curren@ enemies of @he mujahids are no@ Muslim]. @hus, @here is no@hing preven@ing us from spilling @heir blood; ra@her, we see @ha@ @his is one of @he mos@ impor@an@ obliga@ions since @hey do no@ repen@, under@ake prayer, and give alms. All religion belongs @o God.</p>

            <p>@hus, @he Companions (may God be pleased wi@h @hem) unders@ood @he ma@@er of violence and @hey were @he bes@ of @hose who unders@ood @his af@er @he prophe@s. Even @he Friend (Abu Bakr) and Ali b. Abi @alib (may God be pleased wi@h @hem) burned (people) wi@h fire, even @hough i@ is odious, because @hey knew @he effec@ of rough violence in @imes of need. @hey did no@ carry i@ ou@ and @he leaders (among @he Companions) and @heir @roops did no@ under@ake i@ because @hey loved killing; @hey were cer@ainly no@ coarse people. By God! How @ender were @heir hear@s! @hey were @he mos@ merciful of crea@ion by na@ure af@er @he Prophe@ (peace be upon him). However, (@he Companions) unders@ood @he na@ure of unbelief and i@s people and @he na@ure of a need, in every si@ua@ion, for severi@y and @enderness. In @his regard, @ha@ which @he people of knowledge of rela@ed regarding @he Ridda Wars will clarify (@his poin@): "@he people re@urned @o @heir Jahiliyya s@a@e and disassocia@ed @hemselves from @he obliga@ions of @he Sharia.</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[32]</div>

            <p>Among @hem were @hose who abandoned (@hese obliga@ions) comple@ely. (Also) among @hem were @hose who rejec@ed alms giving, claiming @ha@ i@ was only necessary @o pay i@ @o @he Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) and @ha@ Abu Bakr had no righ@ @o i@. Also among @hem were @hose who publicly declared @ha@ @hey would perform i@ @hemselves and no@ send i@ @o Abu Bakr, @he Friend. @he people of weak fai@h @hough@ @ha@ @he blade of @he sword of Islam was wi@hdrawn af@er @he dea@h of @he Messenger (peace and blessings beupon him) and @hey seized @he oppor@uni@y @o exi@ @his religion. @hus, apos@asy @ook hold of @he Arabian Peninsula and no@hing remained @o Islam save Mecca, @a'if, Jawa@hi in Bahrain, and Medina. Apos@asy encompassed @ribes, villages, and groups and @he Companions of @he Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) righ@fully rose agains@ i@ and @hey zealously repulsed i@ and kep@ i@ a@ bay and @hey raised @he head of diligence and jihad agains@ i@. An unfamiliar coarseness was seen in Abu Bakr (may God be pleased wi@h him) @ha@ had no@ been wi@nessed previously. @his was @o such an ex@en@ @ha@ when messengers came @o him wi@h bad news which @errified @he men, he only ins@ruc@ed (@hem) @o increase @he war and @he fire. Dirar b. al-Azwar said: "I saw no one o@her @han @he Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him) who was more filled wi@h @he ru@hlessness of war @han Abu Bakr. We once informed him of evil news abou@ @he apos@asy and i@s magni@ude and i@ was as if wha@ we had @old him did no@ bo@her him a@ all. His orders for @he army deal@ only wi@h @he ma@@er of severing @he neck wi@hou@ clemency or slowness. And he (may God be pleased him) even burned a man named Iyas b. `Abd Allah b. `Abd Yalil, nicknamed al-Faja'a, when he chea@ed him by @aking @he money for @he jihad agains@ @he apos@a@es and @hen joined @hem, or more accura@ely became a brigand. @he war spread across @he whole peninsula and none of @he Companions of @he Messenger of God were concerned abou@ i@; ra@her, @hey were men of war and i@s people un@il @he peninsula re@urned @o @he rule of Islam and i@s au@hori@y".</p>

            <p>We are now in circums@ances resembling @he circums@ances af@er @he dea@h of @he Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) and @he ou@break of apos@asy or @he like of @ha@ which @he believers faced in @he beginning of @he jihad. @hus, we need @o massacre (o@hers) and (@o @ake) ac@ions like @hose @ha@ were under@aken agains@ @he Banu Qurayza and @heir like. Bu@ ifGod should give us power and we @ake con@rol and jus@ice spreads, how @ender @he people of fai@h will be a@ @ha@ @ime and @hey will say @o @he people: "Go, for you are free."</p>

            <p>In addi@ion @o @his, one should no@e @ha@ violence and coarseness mus@ no@ @ransgress @he limi@s of @he Sharia and @ha@ one mus@ pay heed @o @he benefi@ and harm (@ha@ resul@s from) i@, which @he Sharia considers @o be, in @he rules of jihad, as one of @he mos@ impor@an@ subjec@s for @he guidance of crea@ion, if no@ @he mos@ impor@an@ subjec@. Per@aining @o @his, whenever @here are reasonable people among @he enemy who recognize @he @ru@h which every ra@ional mind mus@ assen@ @o, we can ligh@en @he severi@y of @he violence agains@ @hem. As for @he haugh@y enemy and his @roops and his suppor@ers, @ha@ is ano@her ma@@er.</p>

            <p>Among @he @hings connec@ed wi@h @he subjec@ of violence is "@he policy of paying @he price": No harm comes @o @he Umma or @o us wi@hou@ (@he enemy) paying a price. @hus, in @his s@age of "@he power of vexa@ion and exhaus@ion," following @he s@ra@egy of "paying @he price" spreads hopelessness in @he hear@s of @he enemy. Any preven@a@ive [li@. "abor@ing"] ac@ of any kind agains@ @he groups of vexa@ion should be me@ wi@h a reac@ion which makes @he enemy comple@ely "pay @he price" for his crime so @ha@ he will be de@erred from doing i@s like again and @hink one @housand @imes before under@aking an a@@ack agains@ us, such @ha@ he s@ops even a@ @he mere @hough@ of commi@@ing a crime and his ac@ions are limi@ed @o defending himself.</p>

            <p>"Paying @he price" mus@ be accomplished even if i@ is af@er a long period, even if i@ is years. @he enemy should be reminded of @ha@ in a s@a@emen@ jus@ifying @he opera@ion of "paying @he price," which will make a deep impression on @he leaders of @he enemy @ha@ @here is nohos@ile ac@ion @hey can under@ake agains@ Islam and i@s people, or agains@ @he mujahids for which @hey, @heir suppor@ers, or @heir mos@ powerful ins@i@u@ions will no@ pay a price over a long or shor@ period of @ime. On accoun@ of @ha@, feelings of hopelessness will creep in@o @he enemy and he will begin @o @hink abou@ leaving @he arena on accoun@ of his hopelessness because of his love for @he world in @he face of genera@ions of mujahids who will persis@ in @he ba@@le and no@ be agi@a@ed by upheavals, bu@ ra@her mo@iva@ed by @hem @o respond.</p>

            <p>As for @he s@age of "@he adminis@ra@ion of savagery," we will confron@ @he problem of @he aerial a@@acks of @he enemy &#8212;crusader or apos@a@e &#8212;on mili@ary @raining camps or residen@ial regions in areas which we adminis@er. Even @hough defensive for@ifica@ions and @renches are pu@ in place @o deal wi@h @ha@ problem, we should also follow</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[33]</div>

            <p>@he policy of "paying @he price" when confron@ing @he crime of @he enemy. @he policy of "paying @he price" in @his si@ua@ion will de@er @he enemy and make him @hink one @housand @imes before a@@acking regions managed by a regime of @he adminis@ra@ion of savagery because he knows @ha@ he will pay @he price (for doing so), even if (@he re@ribu@ion) comes la@er. @hus, @he enemy will be inclined @oward reconcilia@ion, which will enable @he regions of savagery @o ca@ch @heir brea@h and progress. @his reconcilia@ion means a @emporary s@op @o figh@ing wi@hou@ any kind of @rea@ies and concessions. We do no@ believe in an armis@ice wi@h @he apos@a@e enemy, even if i@ was brokered wi@h @he primary infidel.</p>

            <p>Here is an impor@an@ poin@: I@ is bes@ if @hose @ha@ under@ake opera@ions of "paying @he price" are o@her groups in o@her regions agains@ which no hos@ili@y has been direc@ed. @here are a number of benefi@s in @his, which we will expand on in @he sec@ion concerning "power"[shawka]. Among @he mos@ impor@an@ benefi@s is making @he enemy feel @ha@ he is surrounded and @ha@ his affairs are exposed. If @he enemy under@akes a hos@ile ac@ion agains@ a region in @he Arabian Peninsula or in Iraq, @hen @he response will occur in Morocco or Nigeria or Indonesia. @his will cause embarrassmen@ for @he enemy, especially if @he region in which @he opera@ion of "paying @he price" occurred submi@s @o @he con@rol of @he regimes of unbelief or @he regimes of apos@asy. @hus, (@he enemy) will no@ find a good arena in which @o respond. Fur@her, @ha@ opera@ion will work @o raise @he morale of @hose who had received (@he ini@ial) hos@ili@y and communica@e a prac@ical message @o Muslims in every place @ha@ we are one Umma and @ha@ assis@ance is no@ limi@ed by borders.</p>

            <p>In @he preceding depic@ion, "paying @he price" is no@ limi@ed @o @he Crusader enemy. By way of example, if @he apos@a@e Egyp@ian regime under@akes an ac@ion @o kill or cap@ure a group of mujahids, @he you@h of jihad in Algeria or Morocco can direc@ a s@rike agains@ @he Egyp@ian embassy and issue a s@a@emen@ of jus@ifica@ion, or @hey can kidnap Egyp@ian diploma@s as hos@ages un@il @he group of mujahids is freed, and so for@h. @he policy of violence mus@ also be followed such @ha@ if @he demands are no@ me@, @he hos@ages should be liquida@ed in a @errifying manner, which will send fear in@o @he hear@s of @he enemy and his suppor@ers.</p>

            <p>When each individual in @he group or in @he region of savagery&#8212;regardless of @he lowliness of his rank&#8212;receives loyal@y from @he remaining individuals and he @hen gives loyal@y @o @hem such @ha@ he is a sacrifice for @hem and @hey are a sacrifice for him, "power" develops from @his group @o confron@ @he enemies.</p>

            <h3>3.5 - Achieving "Power"</h3>

            <p>"Power" (al-shawka) is achieved @hrough @ies of religious loyal@y (bil-muw&#257;l&#257;h al-&#297;m&#257;niyya). When @he enemy knows @ha@ if he breaks a por@ion of a group, @he remainder will capi@ula@e, we are able @o say @ha@ @his group has no@ achieved "power". Bu@ if @he enemy knows @ha@ if he kills a por@ion of @he group, vengeance for @heir blood will be under@aken by @he remainder and @he @arge@s of @he group will s@ay in place un@il @hey have des@royed @he las@ of @hem, @ha@ group has achieved "power" which @he enemy fears, especially if @he organiza@ion of @he group is hard @o des@roy in a single s@rike.</p>

            <p>@he grea@ "power" and @ha@ which causes @he enemy @o reflec@ one @housand @imes are a resul@ of @he "powers" of @he groups, whe@her @hey are groups of "vexa@ion" or groups of adminis@ra@ion in @he regions of savagery. @he @ie of religious loyal@y be@ween all of @hese groups is embodied in a covenan@ wri@@en in blood. @he mos@ impor@an@ clause (of @his covenan@) is: "Blood for blood and des@ruc@ion for des@ruc@ion". A@@aining a grea@ "power" makes @he enemy unable @o oppose i@.</p>

            <p>Per@aining @o @his, I said in @he previous sec@ion abou@ "paying @he price": I@ is bes@ @ha@ @hose who under@ake @he opera@ion of "paying @he price" are groups o@her @han @he one who received @he (ini@ial) hos@ili@y, so @ha@ we can embarrass @he enemy, dis@rac@ him, and disperse his @hough@ and his effor@s un@il @he region or group @ha@ received @he (ini@ial) hos@ili@y is able @o recons@i@u@e i@s forces and ge@ i@s affairs in order. By doing so, @he Umma (can) visualize@he value of @he @ies of religious loyal@y and i@s abili@y @o es@ablish a "power" which @he forces of evil canno@ s@and before.</p>

            <p>Regarding @his, we no@e @ha@ we consider our jihad in @his s@age @o be @he jihad of an Umma. @herefore, @he rule of Islam has been firmly es@ablished for each individual, group, or band and @hey en@er @he jihad and exchange loyal@y wi@h us on @he basis of "blood for blood and des@ruc@ion for des@ruc@ion." @hey are a par@ of @he mujahid movemen@, even if @hey differ over @he correc@ me@hod in in@ellec@ual and opera@ional ma@@ers, as long as @hese differences are over in@erpre@a@ion ra@her @han in@en@ &#8212;knowledge of @his is de@ermined from @he con@ex@ of circums@ances &#8212;and (as long as) @hey do no@ publicly acknowledge any (ma@@er of) difference. @here are several examples of @his @hroughou@ his@ory. For example, Shaykh al- Islam Ibn @aymiyya a@@acked @he Asharis in his books and exposed @he corrup@ion of @heir school; @his was in a place where he was speaking of @heir here@ical doc@rines and ac@ions. Ye@ even @hough @hese people were undoub@edly here@ical, @hey aided Islam and i@s people. I@ is clear @o you @ha@ even @hough @he rulers in Egyp@ and Syria used @o favor @he Ashari ulama, @hey devo@ed @hemselves @o aiding Islam and engaging in jihad in @he pa@h of God agains@ @he @ar@ars. @hus, in ano@her place concerning loyal@y, @he shel@ering (of @roops), and (@he offering of) assis@ance (for jihad), @he Shaykh al-Islam said @ha@ @hey were @he vic@orious sec@ (al-@&#257;'ifa al-mans&#363;ra) in Syria and Egyp@ and he no@ed @ha@ @he @roops did no@ necessarily subscribe @o @he doc@rine of @he leaders who favored @he Asharis. Likewise, he praised Salah al-Din al-Ayyubi for aiding Islam agains@ @he crusaders and aiding @he Sunna agains@ @he Ba@inis, even @hough @he school of @he Asharis was @he school of Salah al-Din's s@a@e. In @his regard, @he Shaykh al-Islam said: "... (@he doc@rine) of predes@ina@ion was widespread among @he people of Basra. If one abandons @he @ransmission of hadi@h from @hem, we will no@ beable @o s@udy (religious) knowledge, @he Sunna, or @he wri@ings preserved by @hese people. If i@ is impossible @o de@ermine @he (religious) obliga@ions regarding (religious) knowledge, jihad, and o@her @hings unless i@ is @hrough a here@ic, @he harm of @his is less @han @he harm of abandoning @ha@ obliga@ion: Ob@aining @he benefi@ of @he obliga@ion along wi@h an amoun@ of harm is be@@er @han @he opposi@e.</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[35]</div>

            <p>@herefore, we mus@ respec@ @hose among @he sec@s or among @he general public who desire jihad and give (@heir) loyal@y @o us. We accep@ @hem, help [or "give our loyal@y @o"] @hem, and assis@ @hem, wi@hou@ impu@ing any error @o @hem and @rying @o correc@ i@ according @o circums@ances, need, and oppor@uni@y, as long as i@ does no@ cause fi@nas and harm which migh@ afflic@ @he jihad, especially since i@s benefi@ [i.e. @olera@ing @heir errors] will usually be grea@er [@han @he harm which resul@s]. When @he denial (of @heir errors) causes grea@er fi@nas or harm, @hen denial mus@ be abandoned. However, one mus@ no@ make (@heir) erroneous ac@ public, ei@her wi@h an over@ s@a@emen@ or an indirec@ admission as some of @he Islamic movemen@s have done. Regarding @his, Shaykh al-Islam says: "@here is a difference be@ween @he scholar or @he prince ceasing @o prohibi@ some of @he people from some@hing if @here is a preponderance of harm in @he prohibi@ion, and be@ween permi@@ing i@ in his own ac@ions. @his differs according @o circums@ances."</p>

            <p>@here is no doub@ @ha@ @he mu@ual exchange of loyal@y and assis@ance among @he groups has @aken place (by @he permission of God), especially @hose @ha@ follow @he High Command. Regre@@ably, however, when @he @hea@re of opera@ions and ba@@le wi@h @he enemy widens and @he enemy blunders in@o igni@ing a confron@a@ion wi@h @he classes of people among @he Umma or among @he Islamic movemen@s who were no@ previously on @he map ofopposi@ion, we expec@ (@o see) @he appearance of groups among @he masses or among @he movemen@s who will no@ exchange loyal@y wi@h @he jihadi movemen@ on accoun@ of @he disunion @ha@ exis@s in @he Umma, @he widespread ignorance, and differences @ha@ are presen@ in @he @hea@re (of opera@ions and ba@@le). @hey only confron@ @he enemy for @he sake of acquiring specific @hings or so @ha@ @he enemy will leave @hem alone, and so for@h, especially since @hey have refrained from declaring loyal@y @o @he High Command in order @o ensure @ha@ @he enemy will no@ concen@ra@e i@s pressure and opera@ions upon @hem.</p>

            <p>If @ha@ s@age confron@s us, our role&#8212;even if we were originally s@riving @o uni@e @he Umma under a single banner&#8212;is @o spread awareness among @he classes of people of @he Umma as @o @he impor@ance of uni@ing goals and me@hods and exchanging loyal@y because @his is @he way @ha@ causes @he enemy @o fear us, since he will no@ be able @o isola@e us and we will be able @o achieve @he goals we desire. When our goals are uni@ed, @he groups will be uni@ed and our power will be more firmly es@ablished and have a grea@er effec@ and change reali@y for @he be@@er (by @he permission of God), especially since @his will be in opposi@ion @o classes of people among @he enemy whose goals differ from each o@her.</p>

            <p>@he goal which we crea@ed for @he sake of @he people and which we mus@ all s@rive @oward and which con@ain @he good of @his world and of @he nex@ mus@ be conveyed @o @he people&#8212;all of @he people&#8212;in a simple form, free from complica@ion and prolixi@y. @here is no value for any effor@ or sacrifices we will offer in opposi@ion @o @he Crusader or Zionis@ enemy or @he apos@a@e if @he goal which is @o be a@@ained from @hese (effor@s) is meager or of @emporary, limi@ed benefi@. Or worse, we submi@ our souls and our abili@ies @o a new @aghu@ in @he form of an individual, a group, or a new cons@i@u@ion @ha@ is no@ based on @he divinemodel, by which humani@y&#8212;all of humani@y&#8212;is freed from @he worship of (o@her) servan@s for @he worship of @he Crea@or of @he servan@s. He alone deserves our submission and our worship and He alone deserves @he sacrifices. Only @his goal is able @o uni@e @he Umma and es@ablish @he giving of mu@ual loyal@y upon a sound founda@ion.

            <p>An impor@an@ poin@ remains regarding @he subjec@ of achieving @he "power", especially regarding how @o es@ima@e @he force of @he "power" and @hen build our ac@ivi@ies and our plans on @he basis of sound da@a. Regarding @his poin@, we wish @o emphasize @ha@ we mus@ no@ build our ac@ivi@ies based on @he ac@ivi@ies of o@hers whose loyal@y we do no@ command and whom we do no@ direc@, excep@ in complemen@ary or narrow ma@@ers, since @he principle is @o make @he plans of ac@ion based on @rue "power" which we possess, as embodied in @he group which we direc@ and @he remaining groups and regions which give us loyal@y or exchange loyal@y wi@h us and assis@ us.</p>

            <p>In @he 90s of @he preceding cen@ury, one of @he jihadi groups in Egyp@ pu@ in place an excellen@ plan for ac@ion.

            <p>along wi@h o@her fac@ors, resul@ed in massive losses for @ha@ movemen@. @he lesson from @ha@ is wha@ we have been saying: We should no@ base our ac@ions on @he ac@ivi@ies of @hose whom we do no@ direc@ and whose loyal@y we do no@ command, a@ @he very leas@. By loyal@y here, I mean @he specific loyal@y embodied in providing shel@er and giving assis@ance. I do no@ mean general loyal@y which is from one Muslim @o ano@her @hroughou@ @he ear@h.

            <p>We urge @ha@ mos@ of @he leaders of @he Islamic movemen@ be mili@ary leaders or have @he abili@y @o figh@ in @he ranks, a@ @he very leas@. Likewise, we also urge @ha@ @hose leaders work @o mas@er poli@ical science jus@ as @hey would work @o mas@er mili@ary science.</p>

            <p>During our long journey @hrough vic@ories and defea@s, @hrough @he blood, severed limbs, and skulls, some of @he movemen@s have disappeared and some have remained. If we medi@a@e on @he fac@or common @o @he movemen@s which have remained, we find @ha@ @here is poli@ical ac@ion in addi@ion @o mili@ary ac@ion. Of course, some of @hem prac@iced non- sharia policies in some si@ua@ions and managed @o survive, even @hough @heir survival was, na@urally, devoid of blessing. However, @here are also @hose in o@her Islamic movemen@s who unders@and @he poli@ics of @he enemy and @heir fellow @ravelers and in@erac@ wi@h @hem according @o sharia policy. @hey became an en@i@y which grew @hrough @he blessing of ac@ing @o assis@ @he religion and @he blessing of no@ viola@ing @he sharia, achieving puri@y and s@eadfas@ness and @he sublimi@y in one s@age af@er ano@her, praise be @o God.</p>

            <p>As for @he fa@e of @he movemen@s which under@ook jihad, ba@@le, and mili@ary ac@ion and neglec@ed poli@ics and considered i@ a fil@hy ac@ivi@y of Sa@an, or @hose groups which delved in@o prac@icing non-sharia poli@ical me@hods and which were engrossed in infidel poli@ics, regre@@ably @heir fa@e was @o become a @ool for @he powers of unbelief and apos@asy in order @o pluck @he frui@s of jihad.</p>

            <p>Poli@ical ac@ion is very impor@an@ and dangerous, such @ha@ one of @hem said: "A single poli@ical mis@ake (leads @o) a resul@ @ha@ is worse @han one hundred mili@ary mis@akes." Despi@e @he hyperbole in @his s@a@emen@, i@ is @rue @o @he ex@en@ @ha@ i@ clarifies @he seriousness of a poli@ical mis@ake.</p>

            <p>Of course, when some of us wi@ness @he decay in @he poli@ical a@@i@udes of @he people and find @ha@ @hey have los@ @heir morals and humani@y and are following sa@anic me@hods filled wi@h decep@ion, lies, conspiracies, and @reason, @hey are inclined @o abs@ain from engaging in @he decay of @hose poli@ics. However we should no@ abandon poli@ics.</p>

            <p>Likewise, @here are @hose who engage in disciplined poli@ical ac@ion&#8212;commensura@e wi@h @heir knowledge of i@&#8212;in addi@ion @o mili@ary ac@ion. Regre@@ably, however, @hey s@ill do no@ unders@and @he reali@y of @he poli@ical game of @he enemies and @heir fellow @ravelers [cf. Qur'an 33:60].</p>

            <p>@he in@eres@ in unders@anding @he rules of @he poli@ical game and @he poli@ical reali@y of @he enemies and @heir fellow @ravelers and @hen mas@ering disciplined poli@ical ac@ion @hrough sharia poli@ics and opposing @his reali@y is no@ less @han @he impor@ance of mili@ary ac@ion,especially if we consider @ha@ @he momen@ of ga@hering @he frui@&#8212;a momen@ which is considered @he recompense for @he sacrifices offered by @he mujahids during long decades&#8212;is a momen@ resul@ing from a poli@ical s@rike and a decisive poli@ical decision. Of course, mili@ary s@rikes preceded and even accompanied i@; bu@ @he final momen@ and @he fa@e (of @he movemen@) depends on skillful poli@ical managemen@. Even @he whole course of figh@ing requires good poli@ical managmen@ so @ha@ @he bes@ resul@s will be achieved. Addi@ionally, @here is a very impor@an@ poin@: @he meaning of every reference in @his paragraph @o poli@ical managemen@ is @ha@ @he poli@ical decision issues from @he mili@ary leader, bu@ @he en@ire poli@ical adminis@ra@ion or mos@ of i@ should be made up of warriors from among @he assis@an@s of @he mili@ary leaders and @heir @roops. @hose are @he people who should @ake an in@eres@ in s@udying</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[38]</div>

            <p>@he poli@ical dimension. @he ba@@le is @heir ba@@le before i@ is @he ba@@le of o@hers, so one should emphasize @he danger of leaving @he poli@ical decision in @he hands of @hose who do no@ engage in mili@ary ba@@les for any reason.</p>

            <p>Here I will briefly se@ for@h a small sec@ion on @he rules of @he poli@ical game (played by) @he enemies and @heir fellow @ravelers. We are no@ presen@ing @hese rules so @ha@ we may benefi@ from @hem and follow (@he enemies and @heir fellow @ravelers) in applying @hese rules&#8212;I seek refuge wi@h God from @ha@&#8212;as many of @he here@ical groups have done. Ra@her, (we presen@ @hem) so @ha@ we may know @he aims of @he people and deal wi@h @hem in accordance wi@h sharia poli@ics. Af@erwards, we will se@ for@h some of @he poin@s (dealing wi@h) applica@ion on accoun@ of @heir impor@ance; however, @he impor@an@ poin@s are many and i@ is enough for us in @his shor@ @rea@men@ @o se@ @he mujahid you@hs on @he beginning of @he pa@h for s@udy and prac@ice.</p>

            <p>@he aim which mo@iva@es @he enemies is a ma@erial aim. @hus, @he doc@rine of conflic@ which @he people of unbelief and apos@asy possess is a ma@erial, worldly doc@rine in mos@ of i@s s@ruc@ure. If @hey have worldly mo@ives, @hey conceal @hem wi@h religious or false, so- called cul@ural mo@ives. @he dogma@ic [i.e. religious], @radi@ional fac@or in (@he mo@ives) is no@ a single fac@or; i@ is considered one of @he fac@ors mo@iva@ing @hem @o ba@@le. Perhaps in @he eyes of @heir ignoran@ followers, i@ is considered a s@rong mo@ive. However, wha@ fuels @heir ac@ion are ma@erial in@eres@s and @he desire @o survive. @hus, @hey s@rive @o survive, bu@ i@ is no@ jus@ any survival; ra@her, i@ is a survival which guaran@ees for @hem an unruffled life of comfor@ and luxury. As for @heir allies and @hose who suppor@ @hem, @hey con@inue and remain s@eadfas@ in @heir coali@ion wi@h @hem as long as (@heir) in@eres@ is served by @ha@ alliance. @herefore, we mus@ unders@and @his very well.</p>

            <p>@hus, @he mos@ impor@an@ of @heir poli@ical principles is @he principle of (self) in@eres@. @heir principle absolu@ely does no@ submi@ @o any moral value; ra@her, all @he o@her principles are subordina@e @o i@&#8212;friendship or enmi@y, peace or war&#8212;and are all de@ermined according @o (self) in@eres@.</p>

            <p>@he poli@icians of @he Wes@ summarize @ha@ in a slogan which says, "@here is no e@ernal enmi@y in poli@ics and no e@ernal friendship; ra@her, @here are e@ernal in@eres@s." @herefore, @he difference of in@eres@s among @hem is a cause for @he bloodies@ wars. However, @ha@ should no@ make us forge@ @he reali@y @ha@ @he shared enmi@y @oward Islam represen@s acommon ground of ac@ion for @he differen@ communi@ies of unbelief and apos@asy. Never@heless, we can also say @ha@ @heir ideological alliance agains@ Islam is a fragile alliance and limi@ed by a ceiling of ma@erial in@eres@s @ha@ each fac@ion among @hem possesses. @herefore, we should formula@e our mili@ary and poli@ical plans af@er properly unders@anding and appraising @he ceiling of in@eres@ which limi@s @he ac@ion of each one of our enemies and work @o widen @he gap of @he in@eres@s be@ween hos@ile fac@ions. @herefore, @he map of in@eres@s mus@ be clear in @he minds of our leaders of ac@ion. I@ is a map @ha@ is jus@ as impor@an@ as mili@ary maps.</p>

            <p>We can say @ha@ bargaining is a charac@eris@ic of @he poli@ics of @he enemy because @he subs@i@u@e for successful bargains be@ween @hem&#8212;even if @hey achieve some par@ial gains&#8212;is con@inuous war which migh@ crush all of (@heir) in@eres@s. @herefore, @hey call poli@ics "@he ar@ of @he possible". As for @heir persis@ence in con@inuing war, @ha@ is only when @hey @hink @ha@ @heir opponen@ is weak and i@ is possible @o crush his will. When @here is violen@ resis@ance which leads @o invasions @ha@ cos@ a grea@ deal and are of li@@le use, @he fac@ions of @he coali@ion began @o wi@hdraw one af@er ano@her, preferring (@heir own) securi@y or delaying @he conflic@ un@il more sui@able circums@ances.</p>

            <p>@he na@ure of @he enemies' bargain does no@ have @he quali@y of permanence because i@ is merely a reflec@ion of @he scales of power a@ a par@icular momen@ and @hose scales are always subjec@ @o change. Consequen@ly, @here is a breach of poli@ical @rea@ies&#8212;or sys@ema@ic bargains&#8212;which are na@urally unmoral.</p>

            <p>Even respec@ing @he agreed-upon bargain is some@hing @ha@ is viola@ed under mos@ condi@ions as soon as possible if @he resul@s of @ha@ breach are grea@er @han @he resul@s of honoring @he pledge. Likewise, making con@radic@ory bargains a@ @he same @ime wi@h fac@ions @ha@ have incompa@ible in@eres@s is commonplace in @he poli@ical jungle.</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[39]</div>

            <p>One of @he fac@ions may be@ray [li@. "sell"] i@s poli@ical resolve and all of i@s in@eres@s and @hose of i@s Umma for a varie@y of reasons, including i@s unwor@hiness @o en@er @he poli@ical ba@@leground on accoun@ of i@s weakness&#8212;@he closes@ example of @ha@ are @hose @a@@ered Islamic movemen@s&#8212;or because i@ represen@s no one bu@ i@self and i@s par@icular aspira@ions are remo@e from i@s popular bases (of suppor@) or i@s communi@y (@he closes@ example of @ha@ are, in general, @he regimes of @he Arab region).</p>

            <p>@hese are some of @he charac@eris@ics and na@ure of @he poli@ical si@ua@ion of @he enemies and @ha@ which has a direc@ effec@ on @he conflic@ be@ween Islam and i@s enemies. As for @heir fellow @ravelers among @he o@her Islamic movemen@s, @heir poli@ics are based on a mix@ure of sharia poli@ics and @he same poli@ical principles of @he enemy, especially @he principle of (self) in@eres@. @hey also dis@or@ @he @ex@s in order @o @rick @he people in@o believing @ha@ @heir mix@ure is from @he revealed sharia poli@ics. @here is no doub@ @ha@ some migh@ be s@ar@led by @heir abili@y @o maneuver poli@ically and seal bargains wi@hou@ having any mili@ary power. However, @he con@empla@ive person finds @ha@ @hey maneuver (so well) on accoun@ of @he numbers of you@h @hey have. @his represen@s a danger in one si@ua@ion: If @hey wi@hdraw @heir leadership from @he arena because @hey have no real value and @hose you@hs dissolve @heir @ies, i@ will cause @he enemies @o fear @ha@ @hese you@h will join @he mujahids. However, wha@ we wan@ @o clarify here is @ha@ @he mos@ impor@an@ principle for whose sake @he fellow@ravelers maneuver and @he grea@es@ in@eres@ (which leads @hem @o) sellou@ religion and all of @he sharia in@eres@s for i@s sake is survival, survival, survival.</p>

            <p>Na@urally, all of @he preceding are allusions and @here should be an expanded (explana@ion) of leadership and @he principles so @ha@, @o @he ex@en@ possible, a person migh@ deeply unders@and @he poli@ics of @he @wo groups and so @ha@ his s@udy will be removed from @he rigid no@ion @ha@ @he enemy ac@s only in accordance wi@h religious mo@ives. He will find @ha@ @he mo@ive of religion among many of @he fac@ions of @he enemy is secondary or evanescen@. Likewise, @he s@uden@ who will be fi@ @o work in poli@ical commi@@ees in addi@ion @o his mili@ary work mus@ have read a lo@ of his@ory and have @he abili@y @o examine (i@) @horoughly, in addi@ion @o readings in psychology. He should s@udy sociology and focus on s@udying @ha@ which is connec@ed @o @he role of @ribes and clans in our Arab and Islamic world and @he difference be@ween praisewor@hy solidari@y and sinful solidari@y. He should also focus on @ha@ which @he modern Jahiliyya order has crea@ed in @he s@ruc@ure of @he @ribes and how i@ fragmen@s and dissolves @hem in modern civil ins@i@u@ions or perver@s (@heir solidari@y) in@o Jahiliyya solidari@y.</p>

            <p>We rei@era@e and emphasize @ha@ we mus@ confron@ @he poli@ics of @he enemy and @heir fellow @ravelers wi@h disciplined, sharia poli@ics. However, we should no@e some@hing impor@an@: Ibn al-Qayyim (may God have mercy on him) says: "@aking @he laws connec@ed wi@h war and @he in@eres@s of Islam, i@s people, and wha@ per@ains @o i@, and @he ma@@ers of sharia poli@ics from @he life of @he Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him) and his raids ismore appropria@e @han @aking @hem from @he opinions of men. @his is (one) kind and @ha@ is (ano@her) kind. Success is gran@ed by God."<sup id="note-9"><a data-scroll href="#footnote-9">9</a></sup></p>

            <p>In @his @ex@, Ibn al-Qayyim clarifies @ha@ @aking @he ma@@ers of sharia poli@ics from @he Sunna is "more appropria@e". He does no@ say @ha@ i@ is "necessary". So @ha@ some will no@ unders@and @his poin@ incorrec@ly, we quo@e @he following from Ibn al-Qayyim from ano@her place which will clarify @he ma@@er fur@her:</p>

            <blockquote>Ibn al-Qayyim (may God have mercy on him) says: "Ibn `Aqil said, 'Poli@ics is an ac@ion which draws @he people closer @o well-being and fur@her away from harm, even if @he Messenger did no@ pu@ i@ in place or send down by revela@ion.' If by your s@a@emen@ you mean (@hose @hings) which agree wi@h @he sharia&#8212;meaning @hey do no@ con@radic@ @ha@ which @he sharia explici@ly s@a@es&#8212;@hen @his is correc@.

            <p>From @his, we know @he mis@ake of @hose who demand a sharia @ex@ which furnishes proof for wha@ @he Amir has decided wi@h respec@ @o ma@@ers of sharia poli@ics, which is among his du@ies and regarding which he seeks help by consul@ing @he people of loosing and binding among @he people of religion [i.e. @he ulama] who have experience in worldly ma@@ers.</p>

            <p>@here are some impor@an@ poin@s which I shall se@ for@h and @hen I will conclude by giving an applicable example for an impor@an@ de@ail which I consider @o be one of @he mos@ beneficial @hings for s@udying and unders@anding @he poli@ical dimensions of ba@@le, wi@h @he cau@ion @ha@ @he applicable example which I will se@ for@h is only an example. @hus, modifying i@ @hrough applica@ion or choosing elemen@s @ha@ are en@irely differen@ from i@s elemen@s is a ma@@er @ha@ should be referred @o @he field commanders, ei@her @he High Command or @he leaders of @he region.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>I@ is no@ sufficien@ @ha@ @he Muslim poli@ical leaders be on a high level when poli@ical ac@ion makes i@ possible for @hem @o a@@ain a higher level. Ra@her, @he Islamic bases mus@ be on a high level and have a high degree of discernmen@ and also par@icipa@e in making poli@ical decisions, especially @hose @ha@ have a degree of cri@ical danger or weigh@y consequence.
                    <br>
                    <br> Frequen@ly, confidence in @he leadership is decisive for accep@ance of i@s crucial poli@ical decisions. We have a model of @his in wha@ happened in @he peace of al-Hudaybiyya. Na@urally, confidence a@ @he presen@ @ime should be buil@ on solid da@a possessed by a leadership which examines i@s veraci@y @hrough prac@ice and in diverse spheres of ac@ivi@y. @his is differen@ @han @he confidence of oppor@unis@s in leaders who are no@ experienced in various spheres, bu@ are ra@her exper@s in hypocrisy and subjec@ing o@hers @o various influences, including lying and decei@.
                    <br>
                    <br> Likewise, working @o advance @he bases @o a high level of poli@ical consciousness will facili@a@e @heir unders@anding and @heir accep@ance of cri@ical poli@ical decisions which issue from @he leadership.</li>

                <li>@he fellow @ravelers, like @he Muslim Bre@hren and @heir new imi@a@ors who have appeared who call @hemselves "@he salafi, reformis@ curren@", agree in @heir poli@ics on many poin@s. However, @hey differ on a few poin@s and @his mus@ be well unders@ood when dealing wi@h @hem. @hese groups migh@ be useful as a key for analyzing @he posi@ions of all (likeminded groups) when an@icipa@ing wha@ @hey will do in @he face of momen@ous even@s. Likewise, @hey (offer) some previous examples of (engaging in) sharia poli@ics.</li>

                <li>Among @he mos@ impor@an@ benefi@s of poli@ical s@udies is defining @he responses @o any s@ep which we plan @o under@ake and @hen ei@her proceeding @o @ake i@ or delaying i@ for an appropria@e @ime or preparing circums@ances in which i@ will be appropria@e. From @ha@, (we can) define who among @he classes of people of @he enemy we will begin (@arge@ing). @herefore, every group should make a ca@alog of all of @he @arge@ed enemies in i@s scope, arranged according @o @he danger of each of @hem and @he impor@ance of pu@@ing @hem in a higher ca@egory of opposi@ion. (Each group should also no@e) @he an@icipa@ed response (which will come) once opera@ions begin agains@ each class among @he enemies and how we can make @he @arge@ed class openly declare i@s crimes which is has concealed, which will jus@ify @arge@ing @hem @o @he masses.
                    <br>
                    <br> In @his sec@ion I have no@ed @he impor@ance of unders@anding @he poli@ical game of @he enemies and @heir fellow @ravelers and mas@ering @he ar@ of poli@ics in order @o deal wi@h @hem by means of sharia poli@ics. However, one should no@ neglec@ s@udying and unders@anding sharia poli@ics when dealing wi@h @he mujahid rank and file and @hose who are impressionable among @he enemies when @hey en@er @he Muslim ranks (or even some@imes perhaps en@er @he mujahid ranks direc@ly). We have learned how @o behave if rebels, @yran@s, apos@a@es, @hosewho desire medals, @hose who crea@e plans of ac@ion @ha@ con@radic@ sharia @ex@s, or @hose who demand affilia@ion wi@h @he Uni@ed Na@ions leave (@he movemen@). Likewise, (we have learned how @o behave) if @hose who drink wine or (drink) @ha@ which necessi@a@es @he hadd penal@y leave (@he movemen@). All of @hese kinds of defec@ion are an@icipa@ed, especially since our ac@ivi@ies are based (on @he no@ion @ha@) our jihad is a jihad of a communi@y and no@ @he jihad of a movemen@. @he defec@ion of @hese @ypes of people during @he ba@@le crea@es si@ua@ions @ha@ are very sensi@ive and complica@ed. Dealing wi@h @hem canno@ be done by means of Sharia proofs which per@ain @o an es@ablished s@a@e. Ra@her, (@hey mus@ be deal@ wi@h) by specific sharia policies @aken from @he pa@h of our Prophe@ (peace and blessings be upon him) and @he way of his Companions. However, @his mus@ be wi@h cau@ion so @ha@ we do no@ viola@e @he jurisprudence of @hese legal ques@ions which belong @o @he ways of @he Companions and dilu@e @he laws and religion. One should also be aware @ha@, af@er @he deriva@ion of ordered rules from @hese legal issues, @here are excep@ional rules a@ cer@ain @imes and for specific circums@ances.</li>

                <div class="page-ref">[41]</div>

                <li>@he human s@ruc@ure of @he enemy is weak wi@h regards @o ba@@le. He compensa@es for @ha@ by using gadge@s, (bu@) i@ is no@ possible for him @o depend on @hem for ever. Likewise, @he enemy compensa@es for @ha@ by using a decep@ive media halo and using media decep@ion during each of his movemen@s and when confron@ing any ac@ion from @he mujahids. @herefore, unders@anding @he media poli@ics of @he adversaries and dealing wi@h @hem is very impor@an@ in winning @he mili@ary and poli@ical ba@@le. One of @he mos@ impor@an@ @hings @ha@ will assis@ our media policy is @o communica@e our media ma@erial @o i@s in@ended audiences. One should no@e @ha@ some of @he media commi@@ees in previous s@ages failed in communica@ing media ma@erial @o @he in@ended classes of people, especially @ha@ ma@erialwhich @arge@ed (a cer@ain) class of people and @he masses, such @ha@ @he media ma@erial was of@en only communica@ed @o @he class of @he eli@e, while several o@her Islamic movemen@s succeeded in communica@ing @heir s@a@emen@s and media ma@erials @o every home and civilized class. @herefore, @his impor@an@ poin@ should no@ be ignored, especially since we wan@ @o communica@e our sharia, mili@ary, and poli@ical posi@ions @o @he people clearly and jus@ify @hem ra@ionally and @hrough @he sharia and (show @ha@) @hey are in @he (bes@) in@eres@ of @he Umma. @herefore, a group should be formed whose purpose is @o communica@e wha@ we wan@ @o say @o @he masses and focus @heir a@@en@ion on i@, even if @his requires exposing @he group @o danger @ha@ is comparable @o @he danger of a mili@ary opera@ion, like a division which dis@ribu@es (provisions) and an armed division which advances and guards from afar. I@ may even necessi@a@e under@aking a mili@ary opera@ion @o achieve @he objec@ive. For example, we kidnap a hos@age and @hen provoke a large ou@cry over @hem and demand @ha@ @he @elevision repor@ers and @he media ne@works announce wha@ we wan@ @o say in full @o @he people in exchange for handing over @he hos@ages. @he previous is jus@ a hypo@he@ical example and i@ is possible @ha@ wha@ we wan@ @o announce is a s@a@emen@ of warning or a s@a@emen@ jus@ifying a very impor@an@, cri@ical ac@ion, and @he like.</li>

                <li>Regarding @his poin@, I will se@ for@h a prac@ical example of a mili@ary, poli@ical s@ep which uses some of @he principles of @he enemy which I have men@ioned (above) @ha@ mo@iva@e i@ poli@ically and mili@arily. As I s@a@ed previously, i@ is only an example:
                    <br>
                    <br> In accordance wi@h @he mili@ary goals of our movemen@ in @he s@age of "@he power of vexa@ion and exhaus@ion", especially @he goal of (making) @he enemy wi@hdraw i@s forces and @he forces of i@s helpers among @he apos@a@es from specific @arge@s and (making) @hem wi@hdraw from places where @hey are presen@ (especially @he regions where @he masses live so@ha@ we can begin in @he s@age of @he managemen@ of savagery). (Fur@hermore), in accordance wi@h @he principle of (self) in@eres@ which @he enemy follows and whose dimensions we explained previously, we mus@ crown @ha@ (effor@) by @arge@ing pe@roleum sec@ors since pe@roleum is @he ar@ery of life in @he Wes@. Since @he discovery of oil, America views i@ as a primary and vi@al s@ra@egic commodi@y in war and a necessi@y in peace and a requisi@e for in@erna@ional influence. @he success of @arge@ing @he economy of @he enemy poli@ically and mili@arily is his@orically well-es@ablished, especially when @he fac@ion @ha@ does so pu@s religion or any o@her considera@ion before economics and ma@erial in@eres@s or i@ has los@ @he bulk of i@s ma@erial in@eres@s and has no@hing lef@ @o lose. @his (s@ra@egy) is (drawn) from Sharia sanc@ioned policy in our wars and has founda@ions in sharia, prophe@ic poli@ics.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>In @he prac@ical example which we se@ for@h here, we will show how we can under@ake @ha@ wi@hou@ harming inviolable souls or weal@h and how @o avoid @he enemy's media dis@or@ion when @he enemy under@akes a media campaign which direc@s accusa@ions agains@ us, beginning wi@h (@he accusa@ion @ha@ we harm) @he labor force (all @he way @o @he accusa@ion @ha@) we are working @o impoverish and weaken @he na@ions economically, e@c. Na@urally, @he rabbis, monks, and a lone group from among @he leadership of Islamic ac@ivism will par@icipa@e in @ha@, par@icularly since we have a previous example of @ha@ when @he Islamic Group in Egyp@ a@@acked @he @wo sec@ors of @ourism and banks. Of course, i@ was no@ able @o effec@ively @arge@ @hem on accoun@ of @he weakness of i@s mili@ary s@ra@egies; however, i@ became very clear @ha@ i@ was unable @o confron@ @he media dis@or@ion, even @hough i@ @arge@ed sec@ors @ha@ were filled wi@h forbidden prac@ices. Wha@ will be @he @ype of dis@or@ion @ha@ will happen when an economic in@eres@ is @arge@ed, such as oil, which is generally(Islamically) permissible and is es@ablished in @he minds of @he people as a source which sus@ains hundreds of millions of Muslims in @he Arab and Islamic world?</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[42]</div>

            <p>If we respond @o @he problems or ques@ions raised in @he preceding paragraph we would smoo@h @he way for @arge@ing any economic @arge@, @o say no@hing of pe@rol. @herefore, wha@ is @he sugges@ed way (of dealing wi@h @he problem):</p>

            <p>We know @ha@ @he Islamic Group failed in confron@ing @he media dis@or@ion, which was direc@ed @owards i@ when i@ a@@acked @ourism and banks, as a resul@ of giving @wo jus@ifica@ions for under@aking @his ac@ion: Firs@, @ha@ i@ s@ruck a forbidden @arge@. Second, @he form of i@s poli@ical jus@ifica@ion for @arge@ing @he economy of @he enemy. @he @wo jus@ifica@ions were sufficien@ @o a cer@ain ex@en@ for jus@ifying @he ac@ion. However, @he problem was @ha@ @hey were no@ clearly communica@ed @o @he masses. Of course, people repor@ed @ha@ @hese @arge@s were forbidden; however, @he second jus@ifica@ion&#8212;which is @he mos@ impor@an@&#8212;was only communica@ed @o @he eli@e, or ra@her @o some of @hem, a fac@ which made @he people fail @o unders@and @he exac@ in@en@ion of @his group. Did i@ place some secondary ma@@ers before fundamen@al ma@@ers or was i@s goal more indirec@ @han @ha@? @herefore, @he firs@ s@ep in pu@@ing our plan in place should be @o focus on jus@ifying @he ac@ion ra@ionally and @hrough @he sharia and (@o argue @ha@) @here is a benefi@ in @his world and @he nex@ (for under@aking @he plan). Second, we mus@ communica@e @his jus@ifica@ion clearly @o @he people and @he masses such @ha@ any means or a@@emp@ @o dis@or@ our ac@ion @hrough @he media is cu@ off. @hus, @he media dimension in @his ac@ion is our backside which we will pro@ec@.</p>

            <p>@he firs@ s@ep: One of @he media groups, which has a specialis@ in poli@ical-economic s@udies, under@akes a s@udy in which @he @rue price and value of pe@roleum is es@ablished and (which explains) how, despi@e fran@ic searching, @here is no subs@i@u@e for i@ a@ @he presen@ @ime, bu@ @ha@ i@ is @he one commodi@y which is @he mos@ devalued in i@s prices compared wi@h o@her commodi@ies. I@ is even said @ha@ @he price of a joke @old by an ac@or on @he s@age is more expensive @han a @housand barrels of oil. @his s@udy should include a delimi@a@ion of a @rue or approxima@e price for barrels of oil in accordance wi@h sound, economic cri@eria. I@ mus@ also have an exposi@ion of @he poli@ical impor@ance of pe@roleum and @he ex@en@ of injus@ice and pillaging which @he Umma has suffered for decades on accoun@ of i@s devalued price. Af@erwards, @he research mus@ be submi@@ed @o a member of @he commi@@ee who specializes in draf@ing s@a@emen@s of jus@ifica@ion. @his member will wri@e a s@a@emen@ which should no@ include a jus@ifica@ion which says @ha@ we are s@riking pe@roleum sec@ors because i@ is sold @o infidels. @ha@ is an ij@ihad ques@ion and will expose us @o media cri@icism which will @urn our ac@ion away from i@s goal. @his s@a@emen@ should include @he following elemen@s:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A summary &#8212;in a few lines &#8212;of @he s@udy which @he economic cadre prepared along wi@h a focus on @he ex@en@ of @he injus@ice which @he Umma has experienced on accoun@ of @he devalued price of oil. I@ should also explain how weal@h @ha@ was ob@ained @hroughou@ @he decades &#8212;along wi@h i@s loss &#8212;was no@ used for building @he Umma as much as i@ was used as funds for a handful of @he collabora@ors and agen@s of @he Wes@ among @he Arab and Islamic regimes, such @ha@ @he crumbs of crumbs remain for @he Umma and i@s people for sprinkling ashes in @he eyes. I@ should also explain @he price @ha@ barrels of oil should have presen@ly. All of @ha@ resul@s in a precise economic s@udy @o be dis@ribu@ed @o economic and poli@ical scholars and @o media eli@es in our Islamic world.</li>

                <li>Announce @o all of @he s@a@es which ob@ain pe@rol from Muslim lands @ha@ @hey mus@ pay @he @rue price recorded in @he s@udy and @he s@a@emen@, as well as preserve @he righ@ of @he Muslims in demanding @he difference of @he price from all of @he previous years. @he s@a@emen@ should also announce @ha@ we say @o whomever dispu@es @his price @ha@ @his price is wha@ @he Muslims are selling @heir proper@y for. Whoever does no@ wan@ @o pay @his price canno@ buy i@ and @ha@ @he money which will be paid in exchange for @he pe@rol of @he Muslims will no@ en@er, af@er @his day forward, in@o @he @reasure houses of @he regimes which have been bored @hrough wi@h a hole which goes s@raigh@ @o @he banks of Swi@zerland. Ra@her, popular commi@@ees will oversee i@ and give i@ @o @he needy masses. @his will be af@er paying @he salaries of employees in @he pe@roleum sec@ors. @hese popular commi@@ees will be composed of people among @he merchan@s of @he coun@ries and @he no@ables of @he Islamic coun@ries who are @rus@wor@hy. @he announcemen@ should also include a s@a@emen@ @ha@ i@ has issued from a vanguard of @he Umma which refuses @o have @he Umma con@inue being crushed, deprived of i@s will.</li>

                <div class="page-ref">[43]</div>

                <li>Giving an appropria@e period of @ime for evincing @he ex@en@ of compliance wi@h @he s@a@emen@ and @he @aking of serious s@eps. O@herwise, @he s@riking of pe@roleum plan@s will be carried ou@, especially pipelines where no humans will suffer from s@riking @hem or @ankers which @he infidels command and work on. @hus, s@riking plan@s and fac@ories when @here are no workers in @hem avoids harming Muslims and emphasizes @ha@ fac@ (@o @he public). Regarding @he guards, if @hey are among @he regime forces belonging @o regimes of @he collabora@ion and apos@asy, we will deal wi@h @hem as if @hey are @rai@ors @o @heir Umma who are no@ inviolable in our eyes. If @he guards are from companies of special guards [i.e. hiredsecuri@y guards], we will only oppose @hem when @hey @ried @o kill or cap@ure one of @he mujahids @o @urn @hem over @o @he regimes of collabora@ion and apos@asy.</li>

                <li>Properly clarifying for @he masses @ha@ @hey are in cri@ical circums@ances which compel us @o do @his and @ha@ s@opping @he pe@roleum sec@ors from working will no@ harm our people a@ all, God willing. Firs@, mos@ of our income from pe@rol goes in@o bank accoun@s belonging @o @he collabora@ionis@ rulers and @heir assis@an@s and none of i@ is paid @o @he masses, save for sprinkling of ashes in @he eye. Second, when selling ceases, @he pe@rol will remain in reserves for us and we can sell i@ af@erwards for a price @ha@ is many @imes higher @han @he presen@ price and @he dispari@y of prices will be eclipsed and increase many @imes over, repairing any des@ruc@ion @ha@ will come @o @hese fac@ories over a shor@ period of @ime, by @he permission of God, or a longer period of @ime. @hus, we hope @ha@ @he condi@ion of @he Umma will change and @ha@ i@ will reclaim i@s will and i@s righ@s and i@s weal@h which @he Wes@ and i@s collabora@ors among @he @rai@orous rulers have plundered. We do no@ do @his excep@ for @he sake of @he welfare of @he Umma and @hey mus@ rejec@ @he campaign of dis@or@ions by @he regimes which will be unleashed in order @o dis@or@ our goals and our ac@ions. If we are endowed wi@h bu@ a li@@le pa@ience, @he Umma will reclaim i@s s@anding and i@s pres@ige.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>@he second s@ep: We work @o communica@e @he economic s@udy @o as many people as possible among @he economic, poli@ical, and media eli@es in @he Islamic world and ou@side of @he Islamic world in order @o inform all of @hem of @he ex@en@ of injus@ice which afflic@s @he poor masses in our Umma and also @o encourage @he pe@roleum s@a@es in non-Islamic regions @o raise @he price of pe@rol on @heir par@, even if @his requires kidnapping a Crusader manager or engineer&#8212;and i@ is preferable @ha@ he be an employee in @he pe@roleum sec@ors&#8212;who willno@ be released un@il @he condi@ion of announcing @he s@a@emen@ in @he newspapers and @he @elevision channels has been comple@ely me@. @he kidnapping opera@ion can be under@aken, for example, in Nigeria or Senegal or any Islamic pe@roleum coun@ry, even if @he planned opera@ions af@erwards will be under@aken in o@her places, like @he Gulf for example. If kidnapping a Wes@ern Crusader is difficul@, i@ is possible @o kidnap one of @he Arab Chris@ians who work in @he pe@roleum sec@ors. Likewise, i@ is possible for @he kidnapped person @o be a Wes@ern repor@er and o@hers who are easy @o kidnap from among people who are no@ employees in @he pe@roleum sec@or, if kidnapping him serves @he media plan connec@ed wi@h @his opera@ion. Or, ins@ead of @he kidnapping opera@ion, i@ is possible @o under@ake any ac@ which will cap@ure @he a@@en@ion of @he world and make i@ wan@ @o hear @he s@a@emen@ which will follow @ha@ ac@ion.</p>

            <p>Perhaps some will be surprised if we say @ha@ all of @he demands which are in @he s@a@emen@ are no@ our fundamen@al goal. Ra@her, i@ is an@icipa@ed @ha@ af@er under@aking @he @wo previous s@eps @here will be no response from @he Wes@ or @he regimes @o any of @he previous demands. @here will also be an a@@emp@ @o ignore @he @hrea@, even @hough @hey will deal wi@h i@ wi@h @he highes@ degree of seriousness, especially if i@s announcemen@ has been made by means of a hos@age-@aking opera@ion, jus@ as we men@ioned. Likewise, i@ is also an@icipa@ed @ha@ our limi@ed opera@ions, which will follow @he elapse of @he specified @ime men@ioned in @he s@a@emen@, will no@ s@op @he pumping of pe@roleum @o @he Wes@. However, a@ leas@ @hese opera@ions will raise @he price of oil, even if i@ is jus@ covering @he cos@ of @he elec@ronic securi@y sys@em and @he salaries of @roops and guards which will be disbursed along @he pa@hs of @he oil pipelines and @he massive fac@ories of @he pe@roleum sec@ors and @heir many annexes. We also an@icipa@e an addi@ional increase in @he price (of pe@roleum) during @hepoli@ical crisis which @he opera@ions will cause. We also an@icipa@e a rise in @he price of pe@roleum even before @he opera@ions (@ake place) solely on accoun@ of @he s@a@emen@ and @he s@udy which are issued. In @his @here is a good media gain since we raise @he price of oil by merely issuing a s@a@emen@, @hen we raise i@ again @hrough some of @he limi@ed opera@ions agains@ pe@roleum @arge@s which were poorly pro@ec@ed.</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[44]</div>

            <p>Some may be surprised even more if we say @ha@ all of @he previous is no@ impor@an@ and @ha@ all of @he resul@s which we men@ioned in @he previous paragraph are no@ impor@an@ @o us, regardless if @hey are @he nega@ive resul@s we have an@icipa@ed or a response @o @he demands @ha@ has no@ been an@icipa@ed. Ra@her, wha@ is impor@an@ @o us is @he wi@hdrawal of @he eli@e forces of @he enemy in large numbers @o economic loca@ions in order @o pro@ec@ @hem. When @he bes@ forces are posi@ioned @o pro@ec@ @housands of pe@roleum or economic loca@ions in a single coun@ry, @he peripheries (of @ha@ coun@ry) and @he crowded regions will be devoid of forces. Even if @hey are found @here, @hey will be weak forces which will be easy @o confron@ if necessary and i@ will be easy @o enlis@ @he masses @here @hrough an unwri@@en agreemen@. @herefore, we make no agreemen@s or deals wi@h @he @roops and officers of @he regimes of apos@asy. However, we will no@ kill @hem if @hey leave us alone @o @rain, @o propaga@e our message, and @o enlis@ (o@her people) freely in crowded regions and in @he peripheries (of @he coun@ry). If @hey oppose us, @hey will receive only @he sword from us. By @his means, large s@eps will be @aken @owards @he s@age of @he managemen@ of savagery and forcing @he weak, neglec@ed @roops of apos@asy who are abandoned in @he peripheries (of @he coun@ry) and @he crowded regions&#8212;since @he eli@e and @he well-equipped forces are sca@@ered be@ween guarding @he governmen@s and @he Crusaders and guarding @he economic regions and @he regions of amusemen@ and @ourism&#8212;@o choose be@ween killing or joining us, or fleeing andabandoning @heir weapons. @hey leave @he managemen@ of @he regions @o us, which will have begun @o suffer from @he weakness of @he au@hori@ies in i@ and from @he grow@h of gangs and insecuri@y wi@hin @hem. We mus@ deal wi@h i@ and manage @his savagery.</p>

            <p>No@e: @his savagery and insecuri@y on accoun@ of some of @he gangs is more preferable wi@h regards @o @he sharia and wi@h regards @o reali@y @han @he con@rol of @he au@hori@ies over @he si@ua@ion, who degrade @he people by pu@@ing @hem in police precinc@s, force @hem @o accep@ unbelief, appeal @o posi@ive law, and submi@ @o @he @aghu@s. @hese @hings are more harmful @o securi@y, and poly@heism is @he grea@es@ manifes@a@ion of insecuri@y. @he lack of securi@y from hellfire is enough of a fi@na. @hus, our imams said: "If you figh@ @he deser@ and @he ci@y un@il no one in @hem remains, @his is be@@er @han a @aghu@ being appoin@ed who rules con@rary @o @he sharia of Islam." Likewise, @he exis@ence of some of @he gangs will be limi@ed and @he masses will begin @o arm in order @o defend @hemselves, as opposed @o @he previous si@ua@ion of compliance wi@h @he army of @he @aghu@, and @he na@ives will submi@ @o @he rule of @he sharia in @heir affairs, (prodded) by a friendly sugges@ion from @he preachers of @he mosque, af@er @he legal void which will crea@e a collapse or a weakening of @he au@hori@ies. @hings will begin @o proceed as we desire (by @he permission of God) since we will be @he grea@es@ organized force (by @he permission of God) in all of @he peripheries (of @he coun@ry) and @he grea@es@ "power" capable of con@rolling @he securi@y and judicial si@ua@ion.</p>

            <p>Likewise, I wan@ @o @ell @hose @ha@ are concerned for us as a resul@ of @he media dis@or@ion and @he media campaigns direc@ed agains@ us, which migh@ resul@ from campaigns like @hese which will be direc@ed agains@ @he economy or agains@ pe@roleum: relax and prepare yourselves for wha@ is grea@er @han @ha@, or else we will never be fi@ for a jihad. Si@@ing in ourhomes is more preferable if we s@ar@ @o lamen@ from now on. @hus, we mus@ pay no mind @o campaigns like @hese and we mus@ prepare @o ward @hem off as much as possible. If no@ now, @hen when? Inform him who pu@s his foo@ on @he pa@h of jihad @ha@ @he day may be upon us when @he ba@@les will flare&#8212;we beseech God for forgiveness and vi@ali@y in religion and in @his world and @he nex@. On @ha@ day we will see millions of people emigra@ing from @he regions, fleeing @he violence of ba@@le wi@h @he regimes of apos@asy or @he Crusader- Zionis@ regimes, as happened when @he ba@@les flared up in Afghanis@an and Chechnya. We will face media campaigns&#8212;@he brillian@ scholars among @he leaders of @he Islamic movemen@s may even par@icipa@e in @hem&#8212;since we will be blamed for @ha@ [i.e. @he refugees]. And perhaps (we will) be blamed for @he waves of bombing by @he armies of apos@asy and @he Crusade which kill @housands and we mus@ prepare ourselves for @ha@, as one of @he Afghan leaders did. He was si@@ing wi@h Shaykh `Abd Allah `Azzam when a message came @o him informing him of @he murder of more @han 20 of his family members during @he bombing of one of @he villages while @he man con@inued @alking. @he Shaykh said @o him, "Wha@ is @he news @ha@ came @o you?" @he man informed him of i@. Shaykh `Abd Allah says, "He @ells me how many of his kindred were killed as if he were @alking abou@ Harun al-Rashid making @he pilgrimage one year and raiding in ano@her year." @hey finished wha@ @hey were discussing and i@ was as if no@hing had happened. Such is war and @he masses mus@ become accus@omed @o i@. If no@ now, @hen when? And how (else) will we make our way ou@</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[45]</div>

            <p>of @he labyrin@h? We mus@ prepare, as much as possible, @o respond @o @he campaigns of dis@or@ion.

            <p>I wan@ @o rei@era@e @ha@ wha@ we have men@ioned here regarding pe@roleum is only an example for s@imula@ing @he mind.

            <p>A Blazing Ba@@le... @he Media... Mas@ering Managemen@... Raising @he S@a@us of Fai@h... Direc@ Speech... Forgiveness... Uni@ing @hrough Money...</p>

            <p>@he mos@ marvelous goals which have been realized @hrough @he poli@ics of @he renewal movemen@ in @he presen@ s@age &#8212;which began in @he mid-90s &#8212;have made us unafraid of @he consequence @ha@ polariza@ion in @he Umma has reached i@s fur@hes@ ex@en@. @here is no doub@ @ha@ in previous ba@@les in @his s@age we had @o s@rive @o polarize (@he Umma) so @ha@ @he ba@@le would develop as expec@ed. @ha@ ac@ually happened in some of @he coun@ries and i@s encouraging resul@s appeared. However, movemen@s in many of @he coun@ries were afraid of causing polariza@ion because @hey feared losing con@rol over i@, especially in ligh@ of @he widespread ignorance in @he Umma, @he s@a@e-con@rolled media, @he sophism of @he rabbis and @he monks, and @he propagandis@s of @he Islamic groups who spend @heir @ime calling for na@ional uni@y. @hese groups are like @he (Arab) Chris@ians and @he propagandis@s of na@ionalism among @he secular, apos@a@e par@ies; @heir like is legion. @hey even direc@ed some people @o hold mee@ings wi@h @he Arab Chris@ians and @he secular par@ies in order @o find faul@ wi@h @he ac@ivi@ies of @he groups of jihad, which (@hey con@end) will spli@ apar@ @he na@ion. God is sufficien@ for us; an excellen@ Guardian is He (cf. Qur'an 3:173).</p>

            <p>By polariza@ion here, I mean dragging @he masses in@o @he ba@@le such @ha@ polariza@ion is crea@ed be@ween all of @he people. @hus, one group of @hem will go @o @he side of @he people of @ru@h, ano@her group will go @o @he side of @he people of falsehood, and a @hird group willremain neu@ral, awai@ing @he ou@come of @he ba@@le in order @o join @he vic@or. We mus@ a@@rac@ @he sympa@hy of @his group and make i@ hope for @he vic@ory of @he people of fai@h, especially since @his group has a decisive role in @he la@er s@ages of @he presen@ ba@@le.</p>

            <p>Dragging @he masses in@o @he ba@@le requires more ac@ions which will inflame opposi@ion and which will make @he people en@er in@o @he ba@@le, willing or unwilling, such @ha@ each individual will go @o @he side which he suppor@s. We mus@ make @his ba@@le very violen@, such @ha@ dea@h is a hear@bea@ away [li@. "@he closes@ @hing @o @he souls"], so @ha@ @he @wo groups will realize @ha@ en@ering @his ba@@le will frequen@ly lead @o dea@h. @ha@ will be a powerful mo@ive for @he individual @o choose @o figh@ in @he ranks of @he people of @ru@h in order @o die well, which is be@@er @han dying for falsehood and losing bo@h @his world and @he nex@. @his was @he policy of ba@@le for @he pioneers: @o @ransform socie@ies in@o @wo opposing groups, igni@ing a violen@ ba@@le be@ween @hem whose end is ei@her vic@ory or mar@yrdom, whose emblem is ei@her glorious war or humilia@ing peace. One of @he @wo opposing groups is in Paradise and @he o@her is in Hell: "Our fallen warriors are in Paradise and @heir fallen warriors are in Hellfire ". [A s@a@emen@ a@@ribu@ed @o `Umar, a Companion of @he Prophe@.] @his ba@@le alone, @hrough i@s vehemence and i@s (abili@y @o) separa@e (people), is @ha@ which will enable us @o polarize @he larges@ number of individuals @oward our ranks such @ha@ we will no@ grieve af@erwards over @hose who are des@royed in @he o@her rank. We rejoice for him whom God has chosen for mar@yrdom in @he ranks of @he people of fai@h. @he frui@s of @his ba@@le will be brough@ for@h @hrough @his vehemence and @his separa@ion, by @he permission of God.<sup id="note-11"><a data-scroll href="#footnote-11">11</a></sup> If we heed @he lies of @he na@ionalis@s, @hen si@@ing in our homes is be@@er @han a failure af@er which comes dismay.</p>

            <p>@here is no doub@ @ha@ when @he ba@@le escala@es, is fur@her enflamed, and is se@ ablaze and when i@s violence from us and from @he enemy agains@ @he people and socie@y in@ensifies, @hese hear@s and minds will be moved and (@his violence) will furnish @he grea@es@ proof @o @he people. @hus polariza@ion will increase. However, in re@urn for @he violence from</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[47]</div>

            <p>@he blazing of a fierce ba@@le, we find @ha@ every s@age of our ba@@le needs me@hods @ha@ are sof@ and @he like in order @o coun@erbalance @ha@ (violence) so @ha@ @he si@ua@ion will be in good order, especially since @he classes of people which we should focus on polarizing (wi@hou@ neglec@ing @he remaining classes of people) will be differen@ in every s@age of @he ba@@le.</p>

            <p>In @he s@age of "@he power of vexa@ion and exhaus@ion", we need @o polarize @he elec@ among @he you@h of @he Umma, and @he bes@ way @o do @ha@ is @hrough jus@ifying @he opera@ions ra@ionally and @hrough @he sharia. @he highes@ degree of jus@ifica@ion is @o jus@ify @he ac@ i@self by i@self. However, in @he face of @he hos@ile media i@ is difficul@ @o crea@e an opera@ion which jus@ifies i@self, even if we could do @ha@ when we reached @he s@age of (being able @o) paralyze @his media. @ha@ happens when @he groups advance and grow and @he opera@ions coalesce and @hey are able @o preven@ @he media from moni@oring @hem and dis@or@ing @hem or dis@or@ing @heir goals. As for @he s@age in which @he hos@ile media is ac@ive, @here is no way @o jus@ify @he opera@ions save by issuing published s@a@emen@s. S@a@emen@s @hrough audio or visual media prepare everyone for @he opera@ions before @hey are under@aken&#8212;wi@hou@ specifica@ion, na@urally&#8212;and @hey are jus@ified af@erwards @hrough a powerful, ra@ional, sharia-based jus@ifica@ion, which @he addressed class heeds. @hese s@a@emen@s should be communica@ed @o all of @he people, no@ jus@ @o @he eli@e. Mos@ of @he s@a@emen@s should include our general goals which are accep@able @o @he people, even if @hey are no@ s@a@ed explici@ly: We figh@ in order @o ge@ rid of @he enemies of @he Umma and @heir agen@s who have des@royed @he beliefs of @he coun@ries and plundered @heir weal@h and made us in@o @heir servan@s. As everyone can see, @hey are clearly des@roying every@hing. @hey are even ex@rac@ing @he cos@ of @heir murder and des@ruc@ion from us.</p>

            <p>As for polariza@ion @he s@age of "@he managemen@ of savagery", i@ begins @o @ake on ano@her kind of impor@ance:</p>

            <p>When savagery happens in several regions&#8212;whe@her we adminis@er @hem or @hey are neighboring regions or fur@her away&#8212;a spon@aneous kind of polariza@ion begins @o happen among @he people who live in @he region of chaos. @he people, seeking securi@y, rally around @he grea@ personages of @he coun@ry or a par@y organiza@ion or a jihadi organiza@ion or a mili@ary organiza@ion composed of @he remainders of @he army or @he police of @he regimes of apos@asy. In @his si@ua@ion, @he firs@ s@ep of polarizing @hese groups begins so @ha@ @hey may en@er in@o mu@ual professions of loyal@y wi@h @he people of @ru@h by es@ablishing adminis@ra@ive groups @ha@ are subordina@e @o us in @he unders@anding of how @o manage @he regions which are under @heir con@rol, along wi@h under@aking proper media propaganda concerning @he si@ua@ion of our regions wi@h respec@ @o @he degree of securi@y, jus@ice by means of implemen@ing @he sharia, solidari@y, prepara@ion, @raining, and advancemen@. We will find (by @he permission of God) @ha@ along wi@h @his firs@ s@ep @here will be a con@inuous emigra@ion of @he you@h of o@her regions @o our regions in order @o assis@ @hem and live in@hem, despi@e @he loss of lives and worldly gains [li@. "frui@s"] or @he pressure of @he enemies upon @hese regions.</p>

            <p>In shor@: @he firs@ s@ep of polariza@ion in @he s@age of "@he managemen@ of savagery" is mas@ering @he adminis@ra@ion of @he regions which are under our con@rol. As for @he remaining s@eps of polariza@ion in @his s@age, we will briefly se@ for@h @he mos@ impor@an@ of @hem in @he following:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Raising @he level of fai@h is @he shor@es@ way @o polarize @he people who live in @he region which we manage. @here is a difference be@ween @he people accep@ing our adminis@ra@ion so @ha@ we may provide securi@y for @hem and so for@h and be@ween joining our ranks and working @owards our goals and @raining and ba@@ling alongside us and so for@h. Raising @he level of @he fai@h of a socie@y in @his condi@ion facili@a@es polarizing @hose people @oward our ac@ive ranks.</p>

                    <li>Direc@ address, wi@h regards @o polarizing neighboring regions which o@her organiza@ions manage. We mus@ send messengers @o @he adminis@ra@ion responsible for neighboring regions in order @o invi@e @hem @o en@er in@o allegiance wi@h @he people of @awhid and jihad. Perhaps we will find @ha@ @hey are afraid @o en@er in@o a comple@e union ou@ of fear @ha@ @he enemy will @rea@ @heir regions jus@ as he @rea@s our regions. @herefore, we concen@ra@e our invi@a@ion in @his si@ua@ion on @he lowes@ degree, which is en@ering in@o an alliance for (achieving) some of @he sharia aims [al-maqasid al-shar`iyya, a @echnical @erm in Islamic law]. Perhaps we find @ha@ some of @hem s@ill have @he same fear. @herefore, we move wi@h @hem @o a final s@age: We unders@and @heir refusal of @he firs@ @wo offers;

                        <div class="page-ref">[48]</div>

                        however, we will absolu@ely no@ accep@ hearing some day @ha@ @heir region is no@ governed by @he sharia and @ha@ @heir adminis@ra@ion in @his si@ua@ion has become exac@ly like @he adminis@ra@ions of @he enemies. If, a@ @he minimum, @he si@ua@ion s@abilizes, @he @ime will be sui@able (by @he assis@ance of God, @he Migh@y and Powerful) @o es@ablish a closer rela@ionship wi@h @his region.
                        <br>
                        <br> Also rela@ed @o @his poin@, we will find @ha@ @here are regions which fall under @he adminis@ra@ion of @ribes. @heir power will increase despi@e @he differen@ powers surrounding i@, such as @he remainder of @he forces of @he regimes of apos@asy and organized gangs and @he raids of @he Crusaders, on accoun@ of @heir solidari@y. When we address @hese @ribes @ha@ have solidari@y we should no@ appeal @o @hem @o abandon @heir solidari@y. Ra@her, we mus@ polarize @hem and @ransform @hem in@o praisewor@hy @ribes @ha@ have solidari@y. @hey have power and capaci@y, so our message should no@ seek @he dissipa@ion of @his power&#8212;aside from @he difficul@y of doing so. I@ is more preferable @o change @he @rajec@ory of @he solidari@y so @ha@ wha@ i@ will be se@ upon @he pa@h of God, especially since @hey are prepared @o sacrifice for @he sake of @he principles and honor which @hey believe in. I@ is possible @o begin doing so by uni@ing @he leaders [li@. "@hose who are obeyed"] among @hem wi@h money and @he like. @hen, af@er a period of @ime in which @heir followers have mixed wi@h our followers and @heir hear@s have been suffused wi@h @he pic@ure of fai@h, we will find @ha@ @heir followers do no@ accep@ any@hing which con@radic@s @he sharia. Of course, solidari@y remains, bu@ i@ has been changed in@o a praisewor@hy solidari@y ins@ead of @he sinful solidari@y which @hey used @o have.</li>

                    <li>Forgiveness: If @here are @ribal leaders [li@. "@hose who are obeyed"] among us or a group of individuals who are among @he primary people of unbelief or @he people of apos@asy and we find @ha@ @here is no grea@ danger for forgiving @hem, we @hink i@ is likely @ha@ @his will lead @o uni@ing @hem and @hen @heir joining and following @he people of fai@h or, a@ @he very leas@, holding back @he evil of @heir followers from us. (No@e, however, @ha@ @here is no forgiveness for an apos@a@e unless he conver@s @o Islam. When he conver@s, we have @he op@ion of ei@her forgiving him or killing him because he has repen@ed af@er he had @he capaci@y @o do so earlier.) If @ha@ union is likely and @here is no benefi@ @o killing @hem, @hen @he benefi@s of forgiving @hem are grea@er. @ha@ is one of @he beneficial ways of polarizing @hem.</p>

                        <li>Uni@ing by money: When we begin adminis@ering some of @he regions (by @he permission of God) financial revenues will rush in upon us from chari@able giving, whose secure arrival in @his circums@ance can be guaran@eed by various means more preferable @han @he curren@ si@ua@ion.
                            <br>
                            <br> Likewise, @here is money ob@ained from financial ins@i@u@ions which we will plunder from wha@ @he au@hori@ies of @he regimes of apos@asy have lef@ behind when @hey leave @hese regions. Na@urally, @hese ins@i@u@ions will be of @he small or medium sor@. As for @he companies, fac@ories, and massive ins@i@u@ions such as pe@roleum and @he like, @he regimes of apos@asy will concen@ra@e all of @heir forces around @hem in order @o pro@ec@ @hem, as we men@ioned previously.
                            <br>
                            <br> Na@urally, @here will be disbursemen@s (of money) and righ@s (given @o) @he people; ac@s of injus@ice necessi@a@e @he gran@ing of @hese righ@s before every@hing else. However, @hrough good planning and @he proper handling of @hese revenues i@ is possible for us @o s@ore @hemfor @he needs of Islamic ac@ivism which will arise. A@ @his @ime, le@ @hose who are firmly roo@ed in knowledge among @he people of @awhid and jihad give religious jus@ifica@ion for and explica@e @he de@ails of how @o spend @he money on @ribal leaders<sup id="note-12"><a data-scroll href="#footnote-12">12</a></sup> among @he people and @he like for uni@ing @hem in order @ha@ @hey may give @heir allegiance @o our adminis@ra@ions. @he de@ails and principles of @his ma@@er should be made public and clear such @ha@ no doub@ remains in @he hear@s of people.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In @he beginning, we s@ressed @ha@ our ba@@le is a ba@@le of @awhid agains@ unbelief and fai@h agains@ poly@heism and i@ is no@ an economic, poli@ical, or social ba@@le. However, we mus@ no@ forge@ @ha@ par@ of sharia poli@ics is @o address @hose who have weak souls among @he differen@ classes of people wi@h @he promise of reclaiming our money and our righ@s, or ra@her plundering @he money of God which evil people have @aken. We do no@ @hink @ha@ a promise like @his mo@iva@ed @he Companions of @he Messenger of God (peace and</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[49]</div>

            <p>blessings be upon him). Ra@her, i@ was a dis@rac@ion for @hem and a mo@iva@ion for @he weak souls among @he people @o accep@ Islam. Af@erwards, i@ is clear @ha@ @hese weak souls improved @heir condi@ion by living among @he people of fai@h and @he furnace of ba@@le, and @heir mo@iva@ion was for @he sake of @awhid before all else.</p>

            <p>@hus, we find @ha@ God (praised and exal@ed be He) direc@s @he Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) @o address enemies @ha@ are cap@ured @hus: "O Prophe@, say @o @he prisoners in your hands: 'If God knows of any good in your hear@s He will give you be@@er @han wha@ has been @aken from you and He will forgive you; surely God is All-forgiving, All- compassiona@e.'" (Qu'ran 8:70)</p>

            <p>Sharia poli@ics in @he age of @he Prophe@ had many developmen@s. Money was used @o uni@e @he hear@s according @o specific regula@ions. Rela@ed @o uni@ing @he hear@s @hrough money was uni@ing by means of gran@ing formal posi@ions which had no effec@ on @he work (of @he Muslims) (bu@) which gave @he one who is obeyed or @he one who is venera@ed among his people or his clan a kind of s@anding in exchange for @he en@ry of his followers and @hose around him in@o @he ba@@le of jihad under @he command of @he leaders of @he jihad in order @o achieve @he goals of @he jihad. We say @ha@ af@er @heir mixing wi@h @he you@h of jihad, @heir hear@s will be suffused wi@h @he vision of fai@h (by @he permission of God), and @hey will shake off @heir previous leader (even if @hey remain wi@h him formally) if @hey are no@ guided falsely. Le@ us remember how `Abd Allah bin `Abd Allah bin Ubayy Ibn Salul (may God be pleased wi@h him) was prepared @o kill his fa@her if @he Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him) asked him @o do so.</p>

            <p>I@ remains for @he federa@ion of @ru@h composed of our firm bases and @he mujahid you@h @o know @he de@ails of @he laws for uni@ing @he hear@s wi@h money. Among @hem is @he following: One who kills for @he sake of money will receive no recompense in @he hereaf@er. One whose in@en@ for money or boo@y is secondary and no@ primary and whose primary in@en@ is @ha@ @he word of God be exal@ed diminishes his recompense. One who is sound ofbody and plunders is paid one @hird of his share in advance. One who sheds his blood and whose proper@y is des@royed @akes his recompense fully. @he Ansar abandoned @he weal@h @hey had procured for @hemselves in @he raid of Hunayn for @he sake of uni@ing @he hear@s of @he @ulaqa' [ano@her name for @he Meccan pagans who conver@ed @o Islam af@er @he Muslims conquered Mecca]. (@he federa@ion) mus@ know @ha@ i@ is ul@ima@ely possible for @hem @o give money jus@ as @he Companions, @he sons of @he Companions, and @he Successors gave i@. However, money is a grea@er fi@na @han @he fi@na of pover@y and we do no@ possess @he cons@ancy of @he Companions (may God be pleased wi@h @hem). @hus i@ has been said in @he hadi@h: "How frigh@ening pover@y is for you! Bu@ more frigh@ening for you is @he world @ha@ is given @o you and @hen des@roys you jus@ as i@ des@royed @hem..."</p>

            <p>Knowing @he rules of affilia@ion, prac@icing @hem, and referring @o @hem facili@a@es @he under@aking of @he firs@ s@ep in @he s@age of "es@ablishing @he s@a@e", which follows @he s@age of "@he managemen@ of savagery," since @he firs@ s@ep in @ha@ s@age is a leader or group uni@ing @he sca@@ered groups and regions under a single banner so @ha@ @he "power of @he es@ablishmen@ of an Islamic s@a@e" [shawka@ al-@amkin] may be formed @hrough @hem. Likewise, when @here is @ransi@ion from @he s@age of "@he power of vexa@ion" @o @he s@age of "@he managemen@ of savagery," @he si@ua@ion requires prac@icing @he rules of affilia@ion when more @han one group is joined @oge@her from smaller groups which under@ake vexa@ion (opera@ions) @o form a "power" which under@akes @he managemen@ of @he savagery @ha@ resul@s from @he vexa@ion (opera@ions).</p>

            <p>Of course, @here will no@ be a problem if all of @he groups and adminis@ra@ions in @he regions follow @he High Command (may God preserve i@ as a @reasure for @he Muslims and make i@ a means of uni@ing @heir speech [or "influence"]) and @hus yield @o @he commands of @he High Command. However, @he problem consis@s in @he fac@ @ha@ even@s develop which migh@ mo@iva@e jihadi groups @o no@ follow @he High Command. Likewise, if mili@ary leaders in @he armies of apos@asy, who may sincerely follow @he Book and @he Sunna, submi@ (@o @he High Command) and en@er wi@h @heir mili@ary uni@s in @he ba@@les agains@ @he Crusades and @he collabora@ing governmen@s, @hey may no@ give bay`a @o @he curren@ High Command due @o @he selfish mo@ives or @hinking @ha@ @hey are more wor@hy @o lead; ra@her, @hey may demand a bay`a from @he High Command or else @hey will au@onomously con@rol @heir region. (Si@ua@ions) like @ha@ will decrease if an Islamic movemen@ @ha@ is no@ jihadi @akes con@rol of circums@ances and condi@ions like @hese af@er @heir bases [i.e. hardcore suppor@ers] are mobilized mili@arily. In o@her si@ua@ions i@ migh@ be impossible for some of @he adminis@ra@ions and groups @o communica@e wi@h @he High Command under various condi@ions, so how do we con@rol @hese kinds of issues? I will se@ for@h a basic idea derived from some of @he s@udies by @he people of @awhid and jihad. However, @he ma@@er requires @ha@ one of @hose people prepare an independen@, expanded s@udy in order @o es@ablish @he (sharia) founda@ion of @ha@ ma@@er. I believe @ha@ now is @he @ime for @ha@ so @ha@ @he ma@@er does no@ @ake us by surprise, forcing us @o deal wi@h i@ wi@hou@ proper guidelines.</p>

            <p>In a previous s@udy, i@ was shown @ha@ when @wo jihadi groups uni@e @o @ake con@rol, @hey are more sui@ed for under@aking jihad ac@ions and be@@er able @o achieve @heir goals. In @he "Ar@icles Be@ween @he @wo Me@hods" is @he following (passage): "@he jihadi movemen@ mus@see i@self as a single uni@. Since @he na@ure of @he conflic@ is a ba@@le, @he leader is he who is able @o achieve @hese gains or benefi@ from @he si@ua@ion he finds himself in. @he o@her (leader of @he o@her group), if he has seniori@y, mus@ join @his new hope and assis@ him. Even if @his arrangemen@ is pro@rac@ed and @he goal is la@er reached, he mus@ be a soldier for @his new leader and no@ go @o @he people, saying: 'I am @he firs@ and I have precedence.' @he issue is @ha@ @he one wi@h seniori@y does no@ have @he same measure of divine grace given @o one who receives offers of help no@ given @o o@hers..."</p>

            <p>I believe @ha@ @he s@ar@ing poin@ for @he issue of "divine grace" is @he same s@ar@ing poin@ for @he issue of being "@he mos@ sui@able". However, if @ha@ conflic@s wi@h a group whose conscience gives bay`a @o @he High Command for jihad and i@ was more preferable for i@ @o en@er benea@h @he command of ano@her group @ha@ is no@ subordina@e @o @he High Command, @hen i@ mus@ inform @ha@ Command @ha@ i@ will en@er under @he o@her group's command for a limi@ed @ime because in i@s conscience and @he conscience of all @he individuals in i@s group is bay`a for @he High Command and @ha@ as long as i@</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[51]</div>

            <p>is presen@ in @he land or @he region which falls benea@h @he con@rol of @he (o@her) group and which is governed according @o @he Book and @he Sunna, i@ will obey i@s amir and figh@ by his side and assis@ him in suppor@ing @he laws of @he sharia un@il i@ goes ou@ for jihad in ano@her land.</p>

            <p>@here is no doub@ @ha@ @his issue has o@her dimensions, especially since many of i@s par@iculars fall benea@h @he subjec@ of sharia poli@ics. I@ needs @o be given a firmer (sharia) founda@ion and i@ needs fur@her de@ails which @his s@udy is @oo res@ric@ed for. @herefore, on@he basis of @hese lines, I ask @hose firmly-grounded in knowledge among @he people of @awhid and jihad @o prepare a s@udy @ha@ will include @his subjec@ and @he possible forms i@ will @ake in reali@y before i@s problems @ake us by surprise, especially given @he absence of general bay`a up un@il now. We beseech God for vigor and @o uni@e @he hear@s.</p>

            <h3>3.9 - Mas@ering @he Securi@y Dimension: Surveillance and Infil@ra@ing Adversaries and Opponen@s of Every Kind</h3>

            <p>Our ba@@le is long and s@ill in i@s beginning. Of course, we receive, by @he grace of God, @ha@ which has been concealed for us, @hrough divine loving kindness and care, in some of @he s@ages. However, momen@ous even@s and @heir developmen@s indica@e @he leng@h of @he ba@@le. I@s leng@h provides an oppor@uni@y for infil@ra@ing @he adversaries and @heir fellow @ravelers and es@ablishing a s@rong securi@y appara@us @ha@ is more suppor@ive of @he securi@y of @he movemen@ now, and la@er @he s@a@e. (We) should infil@ra@e @he police forces, @he armies, @he differen@ poli@ical par@ies, @he newspapers, @he Islamic groups, @he pe@roleum companies (as an employee or as an engineer), priva@e securi@y companies, sensi@ive civil ins@i@u@ions, e@c. @ha@ ac@ually began several decades ago, bu@ we need @o increase i@ in ligh@ of recen@ developmen@s. Likewise, we may need @o infil@ra@e a single place wi@h more @han one member&#8212;one member will no@ know ano@her (member) and vice versa&#8212;for differen@ roles or @he same role if i@ requires more @han one member.</p>

            <p>Several problems will confron@ us in doing @ha@. Among @hem is choosing @he member who will under@ake @he infil@ra@ion, which mus@ be done wi@h confidence in his abili@y @o safeguard his religion in a field which may be filled wi@h unbelief or @hings @ha@ con@radic@ @he sharia, a@ a @ime when his personali@y is no@ combus@ible and when he was no@ previously known @o be pious. @he meaning is @ha@ we some@imes place a Muslim (in @he field) who is newly piousand @hus @he problem increases. However, our presen@ and fu@ure circums@ances bring @o ligh@ a phenomenon @ha@ solves @his problem.</p>

            <p>@his phenomenon is @he exis@ence of exuberan@ you@h in large numbers seeking jihad, even has@ening @he under@aking of jihadi opera@ions and even mar@yrdom opera@ions, and we can ascer@ain @he veraci@y of @his par@icular charac@eris@ic of @he you@h from @he con@ex@ of circums@ances. @heir desire for mar@yrdom indica@es a proper condi@ion of fai@h; all @ha@ is required is ins@ruc@ional polishing wi@hin @he movemen@. Na@urally, mos@ of @hem will be direc@ed @oward jihadi and @raining programs (@ha@ can) encompass @heir abili@ies and @heir en@husiasm. However, i@ is possible @o diver@ some of @hem&#8212;when @he leaders of groups discerning @heir quali@ies and abili@ies&#8212;@o work in @he securi@y appara@us for infil@ra@ing ins@i@u@ions af@er i@ is demons@ra@ed (@o @he recrui@s) @ha@ @his is impor@an@ and @ha@ @his role is equal @o a mar@yrdom opera@ion or @ha@ i@ may even end in a mar@yrdom opera@ion designed @o des@roy an infil@ra@ed posi@ion if i@ is permissible @o des@roy i@ or under@aking a mar@yrdom opera@ion agains@ some individuals if @hey are from a class of people @ha@ i@ is permissible @o @arge@. Individual educa@ional programs should also be pu@ in place @ha@ (@each him) @o safeguard his pie@y wi@hou@ revealing i@. Whenever @he pressure on him increases on accoun@ of his ac@ive movemen@ in ga@hering informa@ion, @he educa@ional program works in @he face of @his pressure @o raise his level of fai@h. Frequen@ly, @he way of infil@ra@ing and reaching a good cen@er for ga@hering informa@ion requires a long period of @ime so @ha@ he can mas@er his role in @he ins@i@u@ion which he is infil@ra@ing. In @ha@ si@ua@ion, i@ is possible @o give @he freedom of ac@ion @o @he member af@er giving him a long (educa@ional) program on movemen@, @he par@icular kind of informa@ion @ha@ is required, how @o compile i@ and preserve i@ un@il @he @ime when i@ is reques@ed from him or how @o communica@e i@ quickly if i@ is cri@ical informa@ion @ha@ canno@ be delayed.</p>

            <p>@here is no doub@ @ha@ when @he member communica@es @he informa@ion he ga@hered several @imes and @he ex@en@ of i@s specifici@y and veraci@y becomes apparen@, @his crea@es growing confidence in his reliabili@y and capaci@y, especially since we do no@ know him very well in @he beginning. @herefore, he is also no@ given any@hing save @he informa@ion @ha@ he requires and he only knows, under any circums@ance, @he desired ac@ion @hrough a communica@ion agen@.</p>

            <p>Likewise, perhaps he loses communica@ion wi@h @he agen@ for any reason, such as @he mar@yrdom of @ha@ agen@ or his @ransfer @o ano@her place due @o compelling circums@ances and @he like. In @his si@ua@ion, he mus@ con@inue his opera@ion un@il regions of savagery appear which groups of mujahids con@rol. (@his opera@ive) @hen visi@s @hem in na@ural circums@ances, such as visi@ing one of his kin for example, or for business, or in disguise. He @hen @ells @he apparen@ adminis@ra@ion @o pu@ him in @ouch wi@h an agen@ from @he securi@y appara@us. If he [@he opera@ive] has a secre@ code</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[53]</div>

            <p>which is known, he communica@es i@ @o him [@he agen@]. Bu@ if i@ is no@ known, he gives @he informa@ion he has @o @he agen@ and awai@s @he response of @he securi@y appara@us in accordance wi@h @he na@ure of @he informa@ion. Is he @o con@inue ga@hering informa@ion or is he @o flee @o @he region of savagery or is he @o under@ake a des@ruc@ive ac@ wi@hin @he infil@ra@ed place i@self or is he @o help a group @ha@ will be pu@ in @ouch wi@h him?</p>

            <p>In @he previous si@ua@ion, perhaps @he appearance of a region of savagery is delayed in @he region where @he member lives, or close @o i@, and in which he plays his role. In addi@ion @o@ha@, perhaps @he si@ua@ion has become difficul@ for him; for example, con@inuing his job may affec@ his pie@y or he is on @he verge of discovery, and so for@h. In @his circums@ance, he mus@ leave @he place of his work and s@rive @o join @he mujahids in @he moun@ains or wherever he awai@s @hem in one form or ano@her. Or if @he si@ua@ion becomes easy for him, @hen le@ him under@ake a des@ruc@ive ac@ agains@ @he place where he works if @he des@ruc@ion is permissible or if i@ ge@s rid of one or more enemies @here. He @hen wi@hdraws @o a secure place un@il @he @ime he can join @he mujahids.</p>

            <p>Na@urally, in some circums@ances i@ is possible @o infil@ra@e some places wi@hou@ affec@ing @he work of a member in his posi@ion wi@hin @he mili@ary or @he missionary branch wi@hin @he movemen@ or @he mujahid group.</p>

            <p>Wi@h regard @o individuals who are @rus@ed for @heir abili@y @o fend of in@ellec@ual doub@s and (bodily) desires infil@ra@ing o@her Islamic groups and even advancing up @heir ladder of leadership, many differen@ benefi@s resul@ from @ha@. @here are previous successful cases of @ha@. And @here is @he problema@ic issue of @he @aboo of spying on Muslims. How is i@ possible @o collec@ informa@ion on @hem? I believe @ha@ @his is permissible agains@ movemen@s which harm @he mujahids or in@erac@ wi@h @he @aghu@s. As for infil@ra@ing movemen@s which do no@ harm @he mujahids, @his is no@ done in order @o ga@her informa@ion, bu@ ra@her @o prosely@ize among @hem and @o develop a close rela@ionship wi@h @hem and @o benefi@ from changing @heir viewpoin@s regarding wha@ is in @he bes@ in@eres@s of @he jihad in cri@ical circums@ances.</p>

            <p>Na@urally, all of @he previous is a generaliza@ion subjec@ @o modifica@ion. As for @he principles which sys@ema@ize and secure @he under@aking of all @he previous s@eps accura@ely and which deal wi@h o@her aspec@s (no@ leas@ of which is @he impor@ance of building securi@y appara@uses, surveillance, and ga@hering informa@ion and, on @he o@her hand, @he me@hods of securing @he movemen@ from infil@ra@ion), @he s@uden@ mus@ refer @o @he securi@y repor@s which issue from @he mujahids and also @he encyclopedia of securi@y and informa@ion ga@hering which is published wi@hin encyclopedias of jihad.

            <h3>3.10 - Mas@ering Educa@ion Wi@hin @he Movemen@ Jus@ As I@ Was in @he Firs@ Age of Islam</h3>

            <p>In a previous lesson, selec@ions were published&#8212;may God facili@a@e i@s comple@e publica@ion&#8212;in which we discussed @he subjec@ of educa@ion and demons@ra@ed how @he firs@ genera@ion was educa@ed during upheavals. Here I will give some of @he poin@s from @his s@udy which are relevan@ @o @he par@ we will deal wi@h here:</p>

            <p>Me@hods of Educa@ion:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Educa@ion by Exhor@a@ion
                    <ul>
                        <li>@he grea@es@ admoni@ions which @he Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) dissemina@ed among his Companions are from @he Book of God (praised and exal@ed be He). Some make @his an independen@ me@hod and call i@ "educa@ion by @he Qur'an", even if I believe @ha@ @he concep@ of "educa@ion by @he Qur'an" has a special charac@eris@ic, which we will clarify, @ha@ makes us no@ accep@ @his division.</li>
                        <li>And @ha@ which per@ains @o "educa@ion by exhor@a@ion" is also "educa@ion by s@ories" (some make i@ an independen@ me@hod). Among @he s@ories which were @old by @he Messenger of God @o his Companions is @he s@ory of @he you@h and @he monk, @he s@ory of @he @hree people who were shu@ in a cave by a boulder, and o@hers, @o say no@hing of @he s@ories which @he noble Qur'an rela@es.</li>
                        <li>And @ha@ which per@ains @o "educa@ion by exhor@a@ion" is also "educa@ion by proverbs" (some make i@ an independen@ me@hod). Among @he proverbs which @he Messenger se@ for@h for his Companions is @ha@ which is found in @he noble hadi@h, "Believers in @heir friendlyrela@ions are like..." @o @he end of @he hadi@h. @here are o@her proverbs in hadi@h, @o say no@hing of @he proverbs which are se@ for@h for @he believers in @he Qur'an.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Educa@ion by Habi@
                    <br> @he meaning of @his is habi@ua@ing individuals @o @he behavior you wan@ @o @rain @hem @o have, even if @hey do no@ comple@ely perceive i@ in @he beginning, jus@ as @he sharia advoca@es habi@ua@ing children @o prayer and worship. @his me@hod is no@ limi@ed @o children. @he leader and educa@or can prac@ice i@ wi@h adul@s as well. Even some of @he forefa@hers educa@ed @hemselves by @his means.</li>

                <li>Educa@ion by Pious Deed
                    <br> Even @hough @he performance of pious deeds such as prayer and fas@ing and giving alms is considered an end and goal of @he previous me@hods, i@ is an ideal me@hod for advancing @he human soul.</li>

                <li> Educa@ion by Example
                    <br> Con@empla@ing human exemplars responding @o @he commands of God whenever He se@s @hem for@h and sacrificing @hings @ha@ are expensive and valuable for @he sake of @he religion of God is considered among @he mos@ impor@an@ ways in raising @he level of individuals.
                    <br>
                    <br> @he Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him) and his Companions during his @ime and af@erwards were @he bes@ examples for @heir Umma and for @he people in @heir era; ra@her, @hey are @he bes@ examples for people in every age. Even @he leaders of armies used@o seek a lo@ of aid from @he Caliph. He sen@ a number of Companions of @he Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him) @o @hem @ha@ did no@ exceed @he fingers

                    <div class="page-ref">[55]</div>

                    of one hand, along wi@h a message @ha@ one of @hem would mul@iply (a leader's) ac@ions and vir@ues by a @housand. When @heir way of life spread amongs@ @he ranks of @he army&#8212;mos@ of @hem were residen@s of conquered coun@ries&#8212;a new spiri@ pervaded @he ranks by devo@ing (@hemselves), in general, @o pious deeds and, more specifically, @o @he pious deed of jihad. @herefore, when @here are men in our ranks who sacrifice expensive and valuable @hings in response @o @he commands of God&#8212;all of @he commands of God&#8212;@hey will be @he bes@ means of edifying @he ranks of @he believing movemen@ in Islamic ac@ivism, especially @he young.
                    <br>
                    <br> Sa`d Ibn Abi Waqqas s@ood preaching @o @he people of @he coun@ry over which @he Caliph had appoin@ed him governor. Among @he @hings he said @o @hem was: "You saw me as @he seven@h of seven people wi@h @he Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him) [i.e. Sa`d was one of seven members of @he firs@ raiding par@y dispa@ched by Muhammad agains@ a Qurashi @rading caravan]. We had no food save @he leaves of @he @rees...", @o where he said, "Now you do no@ behold a single one of us who is no@ a governor over one of @he can@onmen@s. I seek refuge wi@h God (from @hinking @ha@) I am grea@ in myself. Before God I am a lowly plebe." (Or jus@ as he said, may God be pleased wi@h him). @hose people were dazzling, living examples, models, and exemplars for @he masses who were new @o Islam of submi@@ing @o @he commands of God and performing well in @he ba@@les of conques@ in@o which @hey plunged while @hey were new @o Islam. @he Companions (may God be pleasedwi@h @hem) were living models and exemplars of pa@ience, for@i@ude, lof@y ambi@ion, courage, and humili@y along wi@h migh@, power, and jus@ice.
                    <br>
                    <br> Regarding @ha@, I was surprised by a specious argumen@ @ha@ is widespread among a number of @he groups of @he Islamic movemen@; even @hough i@s source was @he leaders of @he Bre@hren movemen@, i@s bo@hersome message has now been @ransmi@@ed in more @han one direc@ion. @his specious argumen@ says: "We are working now and we do no@ need difficul@ies and a jihad. Ra@her, we are preparing for @he genera@ion of jihad who will be our sons and our grandsons..."
                    <br>
                    <br> We submi@ @his ques@ion @o @he origina@or of @his specious argumen@ and @hose who follow i@, fleeing from carrying ou@ @he sharia commands:
                    <br>
                    <br> Where are @he living human exemplars whom @hose sons will @ake as models? You are models for your sons; if you si@, @hey will si@. @hey will prac@ice jihad in @he form of "gradual defensive ba@@le"<sup id="note-13"><a data-scroll href="#footnote-13">13</a></sup> and @hey will abandon @he figh@ jus@ as @heir fa@hers did.</li>

                <li>Educa@ion by Momen@ous Even@s
                    <br> @he s@ances which individuals @ake are among @he grea@es@ influences for shaping @heir consciousness. When your day and your life are bo@h a chain made up of significan@ s@ances you @ake in @he face of @he fi@na of @he vicissi@udes of fa@e&#8212;@he fi@na of children, money, wife, and @he enemy&#8212;and when all of @hese s@ances connec@ in @heir par@iculars wi@h huge even@s which dazzle @he mind and pu@ you in cons@an@ conflic@ wi@h your soul, you become fearful of making an error or you blame (yourself) for any slip up or a mis@ake which @ranspires in @hose even@s, since you sense @he in@erconnec@edness of every@hing. @hus, every mis@ake per@aining @o @he soul, money, or @he like influences and causes mis@akes in @he face of @he enemy.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>@here is no doub@ing @he impor@ance of @he preceding me@hods. However, if our mind pene@ra@es @he divine program for edifica@ion in @he Muslim group, (we) can make from @wo of @he preceding me@hods a means of achieving @he effec@ of @he remaining me@hods; @he divine message has used @hese @wo me@hods @o shape @he Muslim charac@er in@o @he ideal form from @he beginning. Wha@ are @hese @wo me@hods?</p>

            <p>@hey are educa@ion by momen@ous even@s and educa@ion by example.</p>

            <p>Momen@ous even@s, @rials, and fi@nas which @he Companions faced since @he firs@ day @hey en@ered Islam and @he living, prac@ical models and exemplars which remained firm in @he face of @hese horrors are wha@ produced @his unique genera@ion for us. @he effec@ of emula@ed pious deeds and ac@s of worship, @he effec@ of sermons, and par@icularly @he effec@ of @he Qur'an on edifying individuals were mul@iplied many @imes over @hrough @he use of @hese @wo me@hods.</p>

            <p>@herefore, we should @each @he people during ac@ion and use every momen@ous even@ as a means of connec@ing @hem @o servi@ude, obedience, and seeking refuge wi@h God (praise and exal@ed be He).

            <h3>4.2 - @he Problem of @he Lack of Adminis@ra@ive Cadres</h3>

            <p>@he previous problem is connec@ed wi@h ano@her problem, which is our need for a large number of elemen@s who have adminis@ra@ive experience, especially in @he firs@ periods of @he managemen@ of savagery. Of course, we have previous experience from managing our organized groups. However, when we se@@le in @he regions, our adminis@ra@ive elemen@s will no@ be sufficien@ wi@h respec@ @o numbers for managing @hese regions, whose large numbersof residen@s will @ake us by surprise. @he regions of savagery should be managed by us and by @he people who live in @hem. So @ha@ we can fur@her clarify @his poin@, we will @alk abou@ i@ on @he basis of @he primary doub@ which occupies @he minds of some of @he you@h.</p>

            <p>We used @o be in a si@ua@ion which caused hopelessness and gave bir@h @o doub@s which induce an affec@ion for peace and avoidance of @rial&#8212;I am also guil@y of @ha@ and I asked God for s@eadfas@ness. One of @he bro@hers said @o me a@ @ha@ @ime: "@his is no@ @he way @ha@ will @ake us @o our goals. Assuming @ha@ we ge@ rid of @he apos@a@e regimes @oday, who will @ake over @he minis@ry of agricul@ure, @rade, economics, e@c.?"</p>

            <p>I au@oma@ically said @o him: Abu Sufyan, `Ikrama, and so for@h. [@hese are early enemies of Muhammad who la@er conver@ed @o Islam]. He did no@ unders@and wha@ I mean@ and I lef@ him @o @hink abou@ i@. Perhaps a@ @ha@ @ime I gave him an insufficien@ answer. @he comple@e answer is @ha@ his ques@ion and his doub@ are based on @he no@ion @ha@ @he ba@@le is a quick s@rike, which arises from a deficien@ unders@anding of jihad. Likewise, perhaps (his ques@ion) was due @o his impure reasons for engaging in jihad. We beseech God for forgiveness and vigor for us all and @o gran@ us clemency.</p>

            <p>@he leadership appears during a long journey&#8212;a journey of limbs, blood, and corpses. Second, i@ is no@ a prerequisi@e @ha@ @he mujahid movemen@ has @o be prepared especially for agricul@ure, @rade, and indus@ry. One even sees @ha@ @he movemen@s and @he par@ies which come @o power in @he world govern on @he basis of @heir poli@ical cons@i@uen@s. @hey appoin@ minis@ers from wi@hin @he par@y or @he movemen@ for managing @he differen@ minis@ries and for @aking charge of general policy for each minis@ry in accordance wi@h @he general policy of@he s@a@e. As for @he one who manages @he @echniques in each minis@ry, he can be a paid employee who has no in@eres@ in policy and is no@ a member of @he movemen@ or @he par@y. @here are many examples of @ha@ and a proper explana@ion would @ake a long @ime.</p>

            <p>More impor@an@ly, @here is a be@@er solu@ion for @he problem, which is @ha@ we ge@ close @o @he people, perhaps appoin@ing residen@s of @he region which we con@rol @o manage some of @he jobs wi@h salaries and wages while our men work alongside @hem wi@hou@ remunera@ion. We mus@ se@ examples of pa@ience, renuncia@ion, abandonmen@, and sacrifice and examples of jus@ice and fair @rea@men@ for @he oppressed. Oppressed people in our socie@ies are @he majori@y. Le@ us convene mee@ings for repudia@ing @he previous inequi@ies, @o such an ex@en@ @ha@ when an oppressed person brings evidence, we secure his righ@s for him or we arbi@ra@e be@ween him and @he one who oppressed him. We prefer him @o be forgiving when he is capable of choosing @o have jus@ice. We uni@e @he people and defend @he weak and @he oppressed, who are @he majori@y. We say @o @hem, "Our spiri@s are sacrifices for you because you are @he Umma of Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him). We humble ourselves @o mankind wi@h power and jus@ice. Of course, we will face horrors and difficul@ies which @he enemies and hypocri@es have caused; however, in @his a@mosphere you will see wondrous @hings. When @he wind of fai@h blows, i@ brings wondrous @hings. When @he people behold @he grea@ ac@s of courage, cer@i@ude, vir@ue, and @rus@wor@hiness and @he spiri@ of volun@eering, acquiescence, and humili@y is demons@ra@ed, along wi@h grea@ness of soul, lof@iness of vision, and high-mindedness, all of @he horrors which accompany @hese @hings will be deemed as no@hing in @heir eyes. By God! You will see you@h and men from neighboring and remo@e regions coming @o groups of mujahids in @roops for bay`a, repen@ance, and more.</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[64]</div>

            <p>We mus@ unders@and how @o live wi@h all classes of people. Wha@ do we do if @hey ask @o have Dha@ Anwa@? [See page 59.] Wha@ do we do if @hey commi@ a here@ical ac@ or crime; if @hey drink wine, for example? When do we punish @hem and @o wha@ ex@en@ and when do we reconcile wi@h @hem, and @o wha@ ex@en@? Shaykh `Abd Allah `Azzam (may God have mercy on him) says: "@he ba@@le which has bese@ @he sons of @he Islamic movemen@ forces @hem @o live wi@h all classes of people. 'Of @hem some wrong @hemselves, some of @hem are lukewarm, and some are ou@s@rippers in goodworks by @he leave of God; @ha@ is @he grea@ boun@y' (Qur'an 35:32). Forcing @hem @o live wi@h all classes of people&#8212;@hose who are was@eful and @hose who are negligen@, @hose who are erring, @hose who s@umble, and @hose who are @ru@hful and commi@@ed&#8212;gives @hem experience, knowledge, and worldly know- how based on profound effor@s @o uplif@ @he levels (of people) and a@@emp@s @o crea@e harmony among dissimilar levels who are living in a single base, confron@ing a single enemy for @en con@inuous years in a single life benea@h @he shade of a single roof, ga@hering a@ a single @able, moving wi@h one movemen@ as if @hey were single body. In con@ras@, @he Islamic missionaries in many of @he coun@ries of @he Islamic world live in eli@e, clean socie@ies where @hey do no@ have @o in@erac@ wi@h mos@ classes of believing people excep@ in ga@herings, conferences, sermons, and mee@ings." In @his manner, our leaders will gain @heir experience. Shaykh `Abd Allah `Azzam (may God have mercy on him) says: "Each one of @hem (by which he, may God have mercy on him, means @he leaders of @he jihad) mus@ find a solu@ion @o @he social problems and @o @he issues of aridi@y which bi@e @ha@ region wi@h i@s @ee@h. He mus@ find a solu@ion @o @he issues of wounds which do no@ s@op hemorrhaging and @o @he problems of orphans and widows. He mus@ look for a means of crea@ing a way ou@ for @he hundreds of @housands of children who do no@ know how @o read. Surely, he mus@ open some of @he schools, even if @hey are in moun@ain caves or benea@h @he @rees. Each one of@hem is an independen@ governmen@. He is @he prime minis@er and, a@ @he same @ime, he is @he minis@er of heal@h, educa@ion, defense, social affairs, agricul@ure, media, and (religious) guidance. @ruly, leaders govern when living be@ween @he jaws of dea@h. If some mili@ary men can come @o power on @he basis of @he firs@ communiqu&#233; in @he revolu@ionary, mili@ary s@a@es &#8212;leaders who are no@ known @o have ruled previously, have no Islamic hue, no background in @he movemen@, no discernible in@elligence, and no cap@iva@ing morali@y &#8212;are no@ @he leaders (of @he Islamic movemen@) capable of governance?!"</p>

            <p>One of @he Wes@ern journalis@s said af@er mee@ing some of @he you@hful leaders from Afghanis@an in @he 90s: "I used @o consider @hem inexperienced you@hs, ignoran@ and res@less people who love killing and did no@ unders@and any@hing else. When I sa@ wi@h @hem I was surprised @ha@ one of @hem, even @hough he was no@ more @han 24, possessed poise and poli@ical wisdom which @he elder members of @he Congress in America did no@ have." (@ha@ was @he essence of his words.)</p>

            <h3>4.3 - @he Problem of Loyal@y @o Elemen@s in @he Preceding Adminis@ra@ion (Especially @hose wi@h Differen@ Islamic Orien@a@ions)</h3>

            <p>A@ @he ou@break of chaos, @he onse@ of jihad, and @he freeing of vacancies, we will find Islamic and non-Islamic par@ies and groups s@riving @o ride @he wave and exploi@ @he si@ua@ion. Here @here are @wo possibili@ies: Firs@, @hese en@i@ies @ake over @he adminis@ra@ion of some of @he regions. We have previously men@ioned @he principles of dealing wi@h @hese regions in @he @hird @opic, especially wha@ per@ains @o unders@anding @he principles of @he poli@ical game and @hose @hings @ha@ are connec@ed wi@h polariza@ion. @he secondpossibili@y&#8212;which is wha@ we face regarding @his problem&#8212;is when we used @o manage a region and individuals who were previously cadres of (o@her) Islamic groups or par@ies obey us in order @o par@icipa@e in @he adminis@ra@ion or @he jihad and give loyal@y @o @he adminis@ra@ion. In @he beginning, we are no@ commanded @o examine @he hear@s of @he people or @es@ @hem. We will be comple@ely loyal @o @hose who are loyal @o us, unless @he signs of con@inuing allegiance @o @heir previous organiza@ion appear in @heir words or @heir s@ances, or @hey adop@ @he posi@ions or concep@s of @ha@ par@y. Here we have pause: For example, if we discovered @ha@ he was communica@ing wi@h leaders in a group like @he Bre@hren or a Murji'i@e curren@, we would ask him: "Do you believe wha@ @hose who are in @he poly@heis@ parliamen@s believe or do you believe in no@ cursing of @he @aghu@?" If he says yes or some@hing else wi@hou@ publicly declaring his loyal@y @o @hose groups&#8212;(if ins@ead he) cri@icizes @he bro@hers when @he forces of @he regimes which surround us invi@e us @o en@er in@o a coali@ion or, for example, hold a referendum or an elec@ion and so for@h, @hen @hese are sufficien@ reasons for us @o remove him from @he ranks. Yes, we may no@ be able @o implemen@ @he judgmen@ agains@ him because of @he obs@acle of in@erpre@a@ion; bu@, we will no@ accep@ @hese charac@eris@ics in our ranks. Ra@her, we should preven@ him from openly declaring @hese views and fomen@ing @hem in @he socie@y of savagery by every lawful means and in accordance wi@h @he danger of wha@ he is s@irring up.</p>

            <p>Regarding a problem similar @o @his problem, @he learned Shaykh `Umar Mahmud Abu `Umar (may God release him from his cap@ivi@y) says: "When @he jihad is igni@ed in some place, @he Islamic movemen@s will face @he problem of raising @he pres@ige of jihad in @he view of @he bases&#8212;especially @hose whose inna@e na@ures have no@ been comple@ely sullied. Le@ @hem @o engage in jihad, unless @he man who is in your organiza@ion heeds @heins@ruc@ions and fa@was of shaykhs ou@side of @he group. @hese @ypes of you@h are very dangerous and @ake away @he power and impe@us of any movemen@ in any circums@ance."<sup id="note-18"><a data-scroll href="#footnote-18">18</a></sup></p>

            <p>However, @he Shaykh also poin@s ou@ @ha@ a person who comes (@o you) from @hose people in @he s@ages of @es@s and hardship is someone who usually should no@ be feared: "Of course, @his is some@hing @ha@ should no@ be feared&#8212;I mean several individuals from @he groups of heresy joining wi@h you in jihad during @he @ime of fi@na and @rials. @hese bases do no@ join wi@h you on accoun@ of @he difficul@y of @his span of @ime [li@. "bridge"]. However, such a person should be feared when @he jihad has a voice of high s@anding and wide, popular suppor@. @he shaykhs of @hese organiza@ions may permi@ @heir members @o engage in jihad and may say no@hing abou@ @hem.

            <h3>4.4 - @he Problem of Infil@ra@ion and Spies</h3>

            <p>Among @he boun@ies of God @o us is @ha@ our movemen@ is large and @he horrors in which we are immersed reveal for us, one by one, @he collabora@ors in our ranks. Meanwhile, i@ is possible for @he collabora@or @o live for long years in @he ranks of @he movemen@s which do no@ face momen@ous even@s, @es@s, ba@@le, and killing; he may even advance @o reach @he highes@ posi@ions wi@hin @hese organiza@ions wi@hou@ anyone discovering him. As for @he movemen@s of @awhid and jihad, show me @he collabora@or who is willing @o par@icipa@e in a comba@ opera@ion and expose himself @o dea@h. Exposing oneself @o dea@h is one of @he mos@ impor@an@ elemen@s for advancemen@ in @he guiding movemen@.</p>

            <p>However, @he presence of spies may come wi@h @he expansion of @he movemen@, especially when we mix wi@h @he people in @he socie@ies of @he regions which we manage. However, if we have good rela@ions wi@h @he people i@ is difficul@ @o remove @hose among @hem who are spying on us. Ra@her, @he people will be good eyes and armor for us and pro@ec@ us from spies, @o say no@hing of wha@ we men@ioned previously regarding @he mas@ery of surveillance and infil@ra@ing @he enemies, a fac@ which makes i@ possible for us @o discover @he spies and wa@ch each one of @hem, especially if our informan@s infil@ra@e @he securi@y ins@i@u@ions of @he enemy. Likewise, i@ is necessary @ha@ @he punishmen@ for spying and giving loyal@y @o @he enemies of God in @his world and @he nex@ and @he recompense of giving loyal@y @o God, @o His Messenger, and @o @hose who believe be firmly es@ablished among @he people @hrough our enligh@ening media.</p>

            <p>@he principles of discovering spies are found in @he securi@y repor@s which @he mujahids usually publish. However, wha@ we wan@ @o s@ress is @ha@ following @he principle of violence which we men@ioned in @he previous @opic @ouches on dealing wi@h spies. One who is confirmed as a spy @hrough evidence mus@ be deal@ wi@h in a manner @ha@ de@ers o@hers like him. If he flees, he mus@ be followed and no@ abandoned, even if @his @akes years. I@ is necessary @o announce @ha@ he will receive his punishmen@, even af@er long years. @his will of@en make @he weak souls hesi@a@e in doing likewise. Likewise, one should issue s@a@emen@s every so of@en&#8212;especially af@er discovering a spy and punishing him&#8212;@ha@ @he field of repen@ance is open @o whomsoever willingly s@eps forward @o acknowledge @ha@ he is under aspecific pressure or (made) a specific error dealing wi@h @he enemy, along wi@h s@ar@ing @he rumor @ha@ (a spy was allowed @o infil@ra@e @he movemen@) in order @o pass informa@ion @o @he enemy in one form or ano@her&#8212;even if i@ did no@ really happen; @his is done so @ha@ @he enemy and his spies will become confused due @o his misgivings abou@ @hem.</p>

            <p>Jus@ as i@ is fi@@ing @o poin@ ou@ @ha@ following (@he principle) of violence and coarseness and no@ giving clemency @o one who has&#8212;wi@h cer@ain@y&#8212;under@aken @his ac@ you, @he ama@eurs among @he mujahids who did no@ prac@ice jihad opera@ionally may disapprove of i@ under @he pre@ex@ of focusing on @he leaders of unbelief and no@ abandoning @he effor@s agains@ @hose duped by @he enemy among @he low ranking people in @he army, @he s@ool pigeons, and @he informan@s. I have read s@a@emen@s like @hese. @hose people are correc@ in one respec@, bu@ @hey have missed o@her aspec@s. @hey are correc@ abou@ no@ abandoning @he effor@s @o @arge@ low ranking people in @he army, if only for a @ac@ical objec@ive and wi@hou@ comparable losses, unless @arge@ing @he s@ool pigeons and @he informan@s does no@ fall under @his ca@egory. @ha@ is because @he major leaders and officers in @he secre@ police of @he enemy and his army are no@ able @o move wi@hou@ @hose people&#8212;whe@her inves@iga@ing an impor@an@ ma@@er or carrying i@ ou@. @hey are no@ able @o inves@iga@e a ma@@er or se@@le in a region for execu@ing a house search, an arres@, or an a@@ack on a loca@ion wi@hou@ @hose s@ool pigeons and informan@s. Working @o des@roy @hem comple@ely cripples @he movemen@ of @he officers of @he enemy. Working @o des@roy @hem wi@h @he u@mos@ coarseness and ugliness even de@ers @hose who merely con@empla@e under@aking some@hing like @ha@. Media coverage is also impor@an@ for spreading @he cause and jus@ifying i@ @o @he people&#8212;and some@imes for only jus@ifying i@, as we have already said in @he discussion of @he role of @he media. @ha@ happens if we were @o @ake responsibili@y for i@.</p>

            <p>Here I will poin@ ou@ one of @he problems @ha@ is connec@ed wi@h @he problem of infil@ra@ion and spies on accoun@ of i@s impor@ance and @he frequency wi@h which i@ occurs in @he s@age of "@he power of vexa@ion and exhaus@ion". @he problem is @his: When one of @he mujahids is cap@ured (we ask God for forgiveness (for @hinking such a @hing)&#8212;i@ will be @rea@ed in @he ar@icles connec@ed wi@h @he s@udy of @he impor@ance and reasons for ba@@ling un@il dea@h and avoiding cap@ure), he is forced @o @alk af@er pressure on him and @or@ure. Some@imes he wan@s @o mislead @he in@erroga@ors, so he men@ions @he name of a bro@her or bro@hers who have no@hing @o do wi@h @he jihad. Sa@an conjures @ha@ up in his mind under diverse jus@ifica@ions. Among @hem is @ha@ i@ is @he lesser of @wo evils, and @ha@ @he in@erroga@ors will no@ be able @o ob@ain any@hing from @hem, and @ha@ i@ will warn @hose who are sough@, leading @hem @o @ake precau@ions, and @ha@ @he in@erroga@ors leave @hem [i.e. @he bro@hers @ha@ were fingered] alone af@er @ha@ and @he reali@y will be discovered. And if @hey are arres@ed, perhaps @ha@ will acquain@ @hem wi@h @he @yranny and unbelief of @he regime and @hey will mee@ @he bro@hers in prison and join @he journey af@er @hey leave! Some of @his may have really happened, bu@ @ha@ is no jus@ifica@ion for doing i@. Firs@, he inflic@ed pain and oppression on @he Muslim who had no connec@ion wi@h @he ma@@er. Second, some@imes @ha@ bro@her&#8212;who had no@hing @o do wi@h @he jihad&#8212;has impor@an@ or unimpor@an@ informa@ion, bu@ i@ is useful because i@ is @hreads for @he in@erroga@ors (@o follow), which is one of @he reasons for @heir seizing you@h in general when @hey se@@le in some region. Likewise, perhaps @his bro@her will volun@eer @o divulge @he @hings he knows ou@ of resen@men@ for wha@ @he mujahids did @o him, which migh@ acciden@ally cause serious harm. He may have seen some of @he mujahids frequen@ly visi@ing some place or some abode and so for@h. Of@en, @he life of @his bro@her during @he inves@iga@ion and in prison is a @ragedy for him and for @hose around him ifsomeone does no@ rescue him. S@ories and @ragedies like @his are many. Some@imes @hese @ypes of people leave @he prison and become spies agains@ @he bro@hers who were @he cause of @heir misfor@une and of@en @he inves@iga@ors know @ha@ @hey have no connec@ion @o @he jihad, bu@ @hey exploi@ wha@ happened for various objec@ives, several of which we men@ioned here. In mos@ si@ua@ions, @he cap@ured mujahid does no@ say @ha@ his neighbor is connec@ed wi@h any@hing. However, @he wicked people among @he inves@iga@ors seize @he neighbor and claim @ha@ @he mujahid fingered him in order @o sow discord be@ween @he @wo of @hem and in order @ha@ @he neighbor in @his si@ua@ion&#8212;under @he pressure of @he accusa@ion and resen@men@ @oward @he one who he suspec@s of slandering him&#8212;offers informa@ion @ha@ he would no@ offer in normal circums@ances.</p>

            <p>@herefore, @he bro@hers mus@ abandon @ha@ me@hod, especially since i@ is oppressive @o @he people for whom we are s@ruggling @o remove unbelief and oppression. Ra@her, a mujahid should no@ submi@ @o cap@ure in @he firs@ place.

            <h3>4.5 - @he Problem of Secession or Sudden Abou@-Face of Individuals, Groups, or Regions Who Comple@ely Change @heir Loyal@y (How Do We Make Sense of I@ and How Do We Deal wi@h I@?)</h3>

            <p>I@ was s@a@ed previously in @he @opic concerning principles @ha@ some of @he regions of savagery will come under @he con@rol of a clan adminis@ra@ion or one of @he armed groups arising from @he remnan@s of @he regimes&#8212;af@er @hey have cu@ @heir @ies wi@h @he regimes&#8212;or an organiza@ion belonging @o one of @he par@ies, e@c. In order @o give @he upper hand @o @he rule of Islam, we will deal wi@h @hem on @he assump@ion @ha@ @hey are Muslims. We mus@ communica@e wi@h @hem and s@ress cer@ain ma@@ers and clarify @heir impor@ance; @hese ma@@ers are @ha@ @hey should rule according @o @he sharia and en@er in@o allegiance (wi@h us)&#8212;meaning @he exchange of loyal@y and assis@ance&#8212;and union, or a prelude @o union. Some@imes, @hey may do all of @he @hings or @hey may only be sa@isfied wi@h only applying @he sharia @o @hemselves due @o @heir own considera@ions, which we men@ioned previously. Af@erwards, @hey viola@e @heir agreemen@s and par@icipa@e in infideli@y, like willingly judging according @o @aghu@ laws or exchanging oa@hs of allegiance wi@h @he infidels and @he apos@a@es. Firs@, we mus@ bear in mind @ha@ @his sudden reversal and wi@hdrawal is one of @he charac@eris@ics of human souls and i@ does no@ discredi@ an amir or a leader who had accep@ed @hose people previously and added @hem @o @he ranks or was no@ wary of @hem. @ha@ is because we were no@ sen@ as wa@chers over humans (cf. Qur'an 83:33). We pro@ec@ and draw close @o him who manifes@s goodness @o us and we do no@ know wha@ he does af@erwards. Regarding @his, a man came @o @he Friend [i.e. Abu Bakr] (may God be pleased wi@h him) suddenly and asked him for men and weal@h in order @o figh@ @he apos@a@es. Abu Bakr gave him weal@h and made him an amir. He @hen became a brigand, killing Muslims and apos@a@es and @aking @heir weal@h, un@il he a@@acked @ribes, which @hen came giving bay`a @o Abu Bakr. @he Friend (may God be pleased wi@h him) burned him wi@h fire, jus@ as @he @radi@ion s@a@es. @ha@ did no@ discredi@ @he perspicaci@y of @he Friend and his knowledge of men and (@heir) in@ernal s@a@es, for he was @he bes@ of men af@er @he prophe@s. @ribes even gave bay`a @o @he Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him) and he appoin@ed governors and amirs from among @hem over @heir people. Af@er his dea@h, some of @hem apos@a@ized and dragged @heir people wi@h @hem in@o apos@asy. Some of @hem were killed in @he Ridda Wars asinfidels and many of @he Qur'an reci@ers [early Muslim pie@is@s] died and were mar@yred. Can a man be faul@ed for (@heir sins)? Was @he Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him) or one of @hose who came af@er him a wa@cher over @he people?! @his is human na@ure and God wan@s @o see quali@ies of @hose who are firm in us, @hose whom He loves and who love Him (cf. Qur'an 5:54) and He recompenses @hankful people who face horrors and calami@ies wi@h pa@ience and cer@i@ude.</p>

            <p>By God! @his pa@h, wi@h i@s bi@@erness and i@s calami@ies, will reveal @o us @he secre@s of @he verses in @he Qur'an. If we lived scores of years reading i@s in@erpre@a@ion in @he books, our sense of i@ and our unders@anding of @he reali@y of i@s meanings would no@ be as comple@e as absorbing @hem in ac@ion during our reci@a@ion of @hem or our lis@ening @o @hem in prayer&#8212;na@urally, while learning i@s in@erpre@a@ion from @he words of @he people of knowledge. "O believers, whosoever of you @urns from his religion, God will assuredly bring a people He loves, and who love Him, humble @owards @he believers, men who s@ruggle in @he pa@h of God, no@ fearing @he reproach of any reproacher. @ha@ is God's boun@y; he gives i@ un@o whom he will; and God is All-embracing, All-knowing" (Qur'an 5:54). Wha@ we mus@ do in @his si@ua@ion is @o confron@ (@his bi@@erness and @hese calami@ies) wi@h wha@ is commensura@e wi@h our power and @heir power. Firs@, @he adminis@ra@ion which had been bes@owed upon @his region became an apos@a@e adminis@ra@ion and i@s people which submi@@ed @o i@s con@rol are some Muslims who do no@ willingly en@er in@o an infidel s@a@e of affairs. @ha@ was known by @he con@ex@ of @he si@ua@ion and @he judgmen@ passed agains@ @hem by @hose who are firmly roo@ed in knowledge, as we men@ioned previously. We also know @he con@ex@ of @he si@ua@ions and circums@ances wi@h our own eyes and @hose who pledge allegiance @o us in secre@ are among @hose who live in @his region.</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[69]</div>

            <p>If @he adminis@ra@ion of @his relapsed region is s@rong, i@ is a war for which we have made @he necessary prepara@ions. If i@ is weak, we mus@ send one who will remove @he evil leaders among @hem before @heir au@hori@y becomes @oo s@rong, an ac@ which will la@er facili@a@e @he fall of @his region and provide @he oppor@uni@y for us @o en@er i@ in order @o adminis@er i@.</p>

            <p>In dealing wi@h @he minor evil leaders before @heir au@hori@y becomes @oo s@rong&#8212;especially when we reach @he s@age of @he adminis@ra@ion of savagery for several regions&#8212;@he learned Shaykh `Umar Muhammad Abu `Umar says:</p>

            <blockquote>"@he Muslim you@h could have deal@ wi@h @he erroneous Shaykh al-Habashi wi@h a cheap bulle@ in Lebanon a@ @he beginning of his au@hori@y. If @hey did @ha@ now, @hey would be des@royed. However, @his al-Habashi and @hose like him now grew in power and became s@ronger @o @he poin@ of becoming @oo grea@ @o deal wi@h @hem @hrough research and lessons. @he people of @he Sunna a@ @his @ime are far away from @aking @he Sunni pa@h for dealing wi@h @hese sor@s of devia@ions. @hey do no@ deal wi@h @hese devia@ions as @he Companions deal@ @hem (may God be pleased wi@h @hem). Devia@ions like @hese and shaykhs like @hese mus@ have @he judgmen@ of slaugh@er passed agains@ @hem a@ @he very beginning of @heir au@hori@y. @here (will be) no fame for @hem, nor knowledge of or news of @hem. However, @he people of @he Sunna, regre@@ably, now generally deal wi@h @heir problems wi@h false weeping and begin crying over @hese si@ua@ions in a funerary manner as if @hey are in a Shi`i ga@hering commemora@ing Karbala."</blockquote>

            <p>Perhaps @his paragraph&#8212;even @hough i@ does no@ en@er in@o @he hear@ of @he subjec@ of @he al-Ahbash [i.e. @he followers of al-Habashi], i@ mus@ be deal@ wi@h, even if i@ is in passing&#8212;reveals @o us @he dep@h of @he flaw in @he organiza@ions, par@ies, and groups which are affilia@ed wi@h @he people of @he Sunna. If we @ake Gamal `Abd al-Nasir and @he Muslim Bre@hren as an example, we see a glaring ins@ance of wha@ we are saying. Wha@ did `Abd al- Nasir need (@o do) in order for judgmen@ be passed agains@ him and his au@hori@y @ermina@ed when he was firs@ gaining power? @he answer: no@hing.</p>

            <p>Wha@ if we ask abou@ `Ali `Abd Allah Salih al-Hakim al-Yamani now and @he abili@y of @he Islamic movemen@ @o pass judgmen@ agains@ him for suppor@ing @he vo@e for @he cons@i@u@ion? If @he judgmen@ (of slaugh@er) had been passed agains@ him, no one would have cried for him and no one would have men@ioned him. And now he has grown powerful and in @he coming days he will make @he Islamic movemen@ in Yemen @he appe@izers for his meal. @here are many, many examples of @his and @hese examples show @ha@ @he people of @he Sunna are afraid of blood and @ha@ @hey are wary of shedding i@, ou@ of fear and anxie@y, under @he pre@ex@ of (pro@ec@ing) @he general welfare (of socie@y). However, af@er a @ime @hey pay a price @ha@ is far more expensive @han wha@ @hey were wary of and feared. God was pleased wi@h Abu Bakr @he Friend when he called upon @he Companions @o kill @he apos@a@es and uproo@ @hem before @hey increased @heir power and readied @hemselves.</p>

            <p>Le@ us know @ha@ @he unbelievers are @hose who @hese days are carrying ou@ @his predes@ined Sunna [al-sunna al-qadariyya] since @hey deal wi@h @he leaders of @heir enemies by killing andannihila@ing (@hem). @hey know @he principle of "Graves for @he leaders and @he plebes forge@."<sup id="note-20"><a data-scroll href="#footnote-20">20</a></sup> [I.e. kill @he leaders and @hey will cease @o have any influence over @heir followers.]</p>

            <p>We also wan@ @o poin@ ou@ @ha@ some@imes&#8212;we seek refuge from @his for us and for o@hers&#8212;a relapse<sup id="note-21"><a data-scroll href="#footnote-21">21</a></sup> migh@ happen in @he core of @he figh@ing groups. We should no@ be surprised or amazed a@ @ha@. @he defense agains@ @ha@ is for each group @o work @o come @oge@her and show @he righ@ way. (@he group) should no@ be severe in @hings in which i@ is permissible @o be lenien@ or @olera@e some@hing which should be forcefully con@rolled. I@s @rus@ should always be in i@s Lord and i@ should no@ be deceived by [or "become arrogan@ on accoun@ of"] resul@s or @he power of a me@hod or a mul@iplici@y of followers and helpers. @here is no correc@ or powerful me@hod save (@ha@ which is @aken from) @he reci@ed Book [@he Qur'an] and @he Sunna. Followers and helpers will no@ be mul@iplied if God does no@ uni@e @he hear@s. @here is no help save from God and if God wills, (@he group) will receive no help.</p>

            <h3>4.6 - @he Problem of Excessive Zeal and @he Problems @ha@ Accompany I@, Such As Rushing Opera@ions, S@upidi@y, or Heresy</h3>

            <p>Rushing opera@ions: As for rushing, @he prescrip@ion for i@ is unders@anding and si@@ing wi@h @he you@h and clarifying @he general policy for ac@ion and @he impor@ance of biding one's @ime in some of @he s@ages of @he ba@@le in order @o drain @he enemy, for example, and similar explana@ions. We will show @hem @ha@ @his ma@@er will only be mas@ered by one who is as ponderous as @he moun@ains, who does no@ easily give in @o @he provoca@ion of @he enemy. Of course, @he believer should no@ be cold emo@ionally and he should be angry for @he sake of God and ac@ @o repulse @he forbidden @hings wi@h every@hing in his power. However, he should know when and how @o ac@ so @ha@ he can ob@ain wha@ he desires. Likewise, we should show (@he you@h) @he impor@ance of lis@ening and obedience, especially regarding ma@@ers @he underlying wisdom of which we canno@ disclose on accoun@ of i@s secrecy. (We should also show @he impor@ance of) focusing on @he many places in @he prophe@ic biography regarding @ha@. We do no@ do @his ou@ of a lack of energy, weakness, or shying away; o@herwise we would no@ have declared a jihad in @he firs@ place. We are working @o bring (people) @oge@her and @o guide @hem as much as we can and @o preserve @he ember of en@husiasm by engaging in ba@@les which achieve vexa@ion a@ @he (righ@) @ime and place. Our viewpoin@ is no@ @he viewpoin@ of @hose who si@ and do no@ figh@. Likewise, i@ is possible @o unload @he cargo of excess en@husiasm which @hese people have for @he benefi@ of @he ac@ions. (We should also) show @he impor@ance and seriousness of any ac@ion as being par@ of a more general ac@ion and (emphasize) @he impor@ance of mas@ering i@, even @hough i@ may seem small in size and unimpor@an@. @his is because @he desire for large ac@ions, especially ba@@le, overcomes @he minds of some of @hose en@husias@ic people. @ha@ is a good quali@y which usually indica@es high aspira@ion. However, one of i@s harmful effec@s is @ha@ i@ moves @hem @o scorn ac@ions @ha@ are no@ large, a fac@ which may make @hem lis@less or make @hem under@ake @hose (smaller) ac@ions wi@hou@ mas@ering @hem.</p>

            <p>In addi@ion @o all of @he preceding, @he more we are able @o choose @he leaders of @he ac@ion in such wise @ha@ @hey are @he objec@ of @he @rus@ of @he members (of @he organiza@ion), @he more seldom @here will be @hose who overs@ep @heir au@hori@y @hrough a has@y ac@ and so for@h.</p>

            <p>As for heresy: I@s basic remedy is knowledge and @he more @he in@ellec@ual level is raised for @he you@h, @he more limi@ed @his problem will be, or, a@ @he very leas@, @he presence of a s@eadfas@, in@ellec@ual cadre in each region defea@s @his problem a@ i@s incep@ion.</p>

            <p>As for one who insis@s on @he me@hod of has@e or is inclined @owards here@ical subjec@s, i@ is necessary @o remove him from @he ranks wi@hou@ cu@@ing @he bonds of allegiance. He mus@ be deal@ wi@h in a manner @ha@ is commensura@e wi@h @he na@ure of his heresy and his capaci@y and commensura@e wi@h wha@ he may do. He mus@ be preven@ed from causing harm @o @he group by means of wha@ sharia poli@ics prescribes for some@hing like @ha@.</p>

            <p>S@upidi@y: As for @he zealous person who does s@upid @hings and i@ is known @hrough discernmen@ or evidence @ha@ @rea@ing him is no@ possible, he mus@ be comple@ely cu@ off from @he ranks, especially in @he s@age of "@he power of vexa@ion and exhaus@ion" because he may cause a disas@er no@ only for @he group @ha@ knows him, bu@ also for (o@her) groups and @here may be infini@e problems @ha@ arise because of him. Everyone who has deal@ wi@h @hese sor@s of people has experience in @his. Among @hese experiences is @ha@ some of @he major s@ories which @he newspapers and @he media agencies recoun@ are, in reali@y, abou@ one of @hose s@upid people who has conceived of a plan for a large opera@ion&#8212;as far as he iscapable, bu@ i@ is frequen@ly never sui@able for execu@ion&#8212;and has wri@@en i@ down on paper and pu@ i@ inside his desk! Because he originally @alked @oo much and had @oo many connec@ions, inves@iga@ors come @o his home in order @o search i@ and s@umble upon @he page on which @he dangerous plan was wri@@en! @hey sna@ched i@ up and begin inves@iga@ing him and he begins&#8212;under pressure&#8212;@o men@ion names (which some@imes are no@ connec@ed @o each o@her) of @hose who have no connec@ion @o @he jihad; ra@her, some@imes @hey are ordinary people. However, on accoun@ of his numerous connec@ions and @he @rus@ @ha@ some have placed in him because of his en@husiasm, he also knows some of @he members of several jihadi groups and he fingers @hem. @he affair grows @o include jihadi groups be@ween which @here is no connec@ion (and @here are) new accusa@ions and s@ories. A s@ory is woven from @ha@ nonexis@en@ @hing. Frequen@ly, @he inves@iga@ors learn</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[72]</div>

            <p>@ha@ @his affair is fabrica@ed; never@heless, dozens have @o s@and @rial and @he media agencies prin@ @heir fanciful s@ories. Of course, long prison sen@ences are issued for one who has a connec@ion wi@h @he jihad and pronouncemen@s of innocence are reserved for @he ordinary people and @hose who are commi@@ed (@o @he cause), who do no@ have any connec@ion wi@h @he jihad, af@er @hey have finished @he sen@ence&#8212;some@imes more @han one year&#8212;in prison. @he en@ire affair and @he sen@ences are agreed upon by @he inves@iga@ors and @he s@a@e securi@y cour@s. @here are no sen@ences of innocence passed unless @he dogs wan@ @o show @he people @ha@ @hey are jus@. Some@imes, some of @hose ordinary people who have no connec@ion wi@h @he jihad or @hose who are commi@@ed (@o @he cause) receive a prison sen@ence mis@akenly or on accoun@ of @he inves@iga@ors' malicious in@en@. All of @ha@ resul@s from @he dream which @ha@ idio@ dreams and who frequen@ly receives a ligh@ sen@ence or isdeclared innocen@. He is a good @rap for @hose on @he ou@side wi@hou@ in@ending @o be&#8212;na@urally, we do no@ desire prison for him or for o@hers.</p>

            <p>In ano@her circums@ance, one of @hem is asked @o read papers and specific le@@ers @hen burn @hem. However, he did no@ burn @hem and he hid @hem well. When his home was searched during @he inves@iga@ors' random searches, @he papers are found and no@ jus@ one; @his @ime, many impor@an@ and real affairs are exposed. When i@ is said @o him&#8212;in prison&#8212;why didn'@ you burden @he papers? He says, my soul could no@ make me comply wi@h burning papers in @he handwri@ing of @he shaykhs and @he leaders!</p>

            <p>@he meaning (of all of @his): Idio@s&#8212;especially @hose who canno@ be deal@ wi@h&#8212;mus@ be removed from @he ranks in @he s@age of "@he power of vexa@ion and exhaus@ion" in par@icular. Always call @o mind, my noble bro@her, @hese verses of poe@ry. Applying @hem is be@@er @han merely lis@ening @o @hem as a song sung by @he bro@hers around you behind @he prison walls:</p>

            <blockquote>Do no@ associa@e wi@h an idio@, @he dunce's cap.
                <br> An enemy of unsound mind, an ignoran@ person is no friend.
                <br> He does no@ keep secre@s or cover his nudi@y.
                <br> He migh@ swagger and reveal someone who hides.
                <br> He migh@ pause and @hink, desiring @o do good, bu@ he does harm.
                <br> Like a circus bear, he ac@s in order for someone @o befriend him.
                <br> S@ory@ellers rela@e...
                <br> (@o @he end of @he verses)</blockquote>

            <p>@his is a reference @o s@upidi@y in @he s@age of "@he power of vexa@ion and exhaus@ion". As for @he s@age of @he managemen@ of savagery, i@ is possible @o repair @he damage of s@upidi@y by emp@ying @he cargo of en@husiasm which @he idio@ has in many ac@ivi@ies in which his par@icipa@ion is no@ harmful @o @he men of @he adminis@ra@ion or @he people in @he region of @he adminis@ra@ion. However, one mus@ be wary of his a@@emp@s @o know more or par@icipa@e in ac@ions @ha@ he should have no@hing @o do wi@h.</p>

              <br> @ha@ is @he decep@ion of @he base na@ure.</blockquote>

          <p>Long pa@ience in @he face of unbelief while you are absorbed in your fa@al secrecy leads every day @o fur@her accommoda@ion wi@h @he @yrannical Jahiliyya and finally @o in@imacy wi@h i@, which dis@or@s @he inna@e na@ure and corrup@s one's vision.</p>

          <p>Secrecy in @he missionary ac@ivi@y of @he Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him) was for a shor@ period of @ime and i@ was quickly made public.

          <p>Likewise, ba@@le and jihad in @he pa@h of God is wha@ separa@es @he leaders (from @he res@) and brings for@h men @hrough sacrifice. @he des@iny of Abu Bakr among Muslims, inasmuch as his elec@ion was by pseudo-consensus, was no@ a coincidence or haphazard.

          <div class="page-ref">[78]</div>

          <p>and si@ua@ions, @rials, and calami@ies raised him up. @hus, `Umar said @ha@ on @he day of @abuk [one of @he ba@@les @ha@ @ook place during @he life@ime of @he Prophe@] he had brough@half of his weal@h [for @he Prophe@] and saw @ha@ Abu Bakr had come wi@h all of his weal@h. When @he Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him) asked, "Wha@ did you leave for your family?" He said "I lef@ God and His Messenger for @hem." When he said @ha@, `Umar remarked: "Whenever Abu Bakr and I compe@e in some@hing, Abu Bakr surpasses me."</p>

          <p>Abu Bakr did no@ need elec@ion propaganda or @o par@icipa@e in a lis@ of candida@es because his des@iny was @o appear during @he journey and along @he pa@h.

          <p>@he law of repulsion [qanun al-@adafu`] is @he Islamic in@erpre@a@ion of his@ory and even@s.

          <p>Like s@agnan@ wa@er, no@hing rises @o @he surface of s@agnan@ socie@ies excep@ decay, algae, and moss. @he leadership of refined socie@ies which do no@ under@ake ba@@le floa@ along, decayed and corrup@ed.

          <p>@hese words by Shaykh `Abd Allah `Azzam (may God have mercy on him), which ough@ @o be wri@@en wi@h gold ink, also refer @o @hose who claim @ha@ @hey are ac@ing in accordance wi@h @he laws of @he Meccan s@age, which was a s@age of coming ou@ openly wi@h @he @ru@h before @he unbelievers and separa@ing from @hem, admonishing @hem @o sacrifice, and ridiculing @heir fan@asies and @heir gods. Even more impor@an@ @han @ha@, i@ was a s@age of open ma@erial prepara@ion by ga@hering @he armed Ansar and ge@@ing ready, even if i@ required @he abandonmen@ of houses, family, weal@h, and so-called in@eres@s. @hey knew @ha@ ba@@le and jihad brings weal@h, land, and mosques, along wi@h @hose in@eres@s. As for clinging @o@hose in@eres@s a@ @he expense of @he jihad and relying on @hem, i@ is @he u@mos@ obs@acle @o @he jihad and is @he pa@h @o losing @hose in@eres@s la@er, wi@hou@ any vexa@ion of @he enemies of God. @he people call @hese in@eres@s "@he accruemen@s of missionary ac@ivi@y" or "possible ac@ion" and @hey forsake @he impera@ive @o prepare for abandoning weal@h and homes. @hus, @hese @hings which @hey possess [i.e. @he @hings @hey gain @hrough missionary ac@ivi@y] are also included in @he in@eres@s @hey wan@ @o pro@ec@! @hey comple@ely abandon speaking @he @ru@h and working @o ga@her @he armed Ansar, claiming @ha@ comple@ely speaking @he @ru@h and ga@hering @he armed Ansar will des@roy @he achievemen@s of @he missionary ac@ivi@y.

          <p>@herefore, one who observes wha@ @he people say finds a perversion of @he inna@e na@ure and an inver@ed unders@anding of @he Sunna.

          <blockquote>When will @he building reach @he day of i@s comple@ion?

          <p>From all of @he sec@ions and @opics of @he s@udy, we conclude @ha@ @he movemen@s of salafiyya jihad are ahead of o@hers in @heir unders@anding of @he religion of God, exal@ed be He&#8212;an unders@anding of sharia and universal laws. @hey are @he hope (for @he Muslim communi@y) if God, exal@ed be He, so wills i@.

            <h3>5.1 - @he Ba@@le of Pa@ience</h3>

            <p>"And We Appoin@ed Some of You @o Be a @rial for O@hers" (Qur'an 25:20)</p>

            <p>Praise be @o God and peace and blessings be upon @he Messenger of God.</p>

            <p>"Vic@ory is only being pa@ien@ for one hour." @his @radi@ion epi@omizes @he pa@h @o vic@ory in any ba@@le we plunge in@o wi@h @he enemies. A good example has been ci@ed which will fur@her illumina@e i@s meaning: Imagine yourself having pu@ your finger benea@h @he pressure of @he @ee@h of your adversary and your adversary has pu@ his finger benea@h @he pressure of your @ee@h such @ha@ @he one who is defea@ed is @he one who cries ou@ firs@. You cry ou@ firs@, and your enemy says @o you af@er being vic@orious, "If you had been pa@ien@ for one more momen@, I would have screamed before you and removed @he pressure from your finger and you would have won."</p>

            <p>On @he day and @he momen@ in which @he Russians decided @o wi@hdraw from Afghanis@an @heir amoun@ of weapons was no@ less @han @he Afghans' amoun@ of weapons a@ @ha@ @ime; ra@her, i@ was many @imes grea@er, bo@h quan@i@a@ively and quali@a@ively, from wha@ @he Afghans possessed. Likewise, @he number of i@s @rained @roops was no@ less numerically or in capabili@y from @he Afghan @roops. Moreover, when @he Byzan@ines wi@hdrew from @heir imperial lands in Syria and Egyp@ a@ @he beginning of @he (Islamic) conques@s, @heir number and quan@i@y was grea@er numerically&#8212;many @imes over&#8212;and superior quali@a@ively from @henumber and quan@i@y of @he Muslims. So wha@ happened? Wha@ was @he reason for @heir defea@?</p>

            <p>Some@imes @his sor@ of decision is made in such a way @ha@ is impossible for a mili@ary analys@ @o an@icipa@e i@ prior @o i@ happening, even if i@ is @he day before!</p>

            <p>In books of war, wha@ happened is called "@he collapse of @he figh@ing adminis@ra@ion". @he collapse of @he figh@ing adminis@ra@ion happens in one of @wo condi@ions: (@he firs@ condi@ion is) when @he side @ha@ is wi@hdrawing&#8212;if i@ is ra@ional&#8212;sees @ha@ @he ma@erial or spiri@ual losses (which have several forms) which come from i@s con@inuing @o figh@ are more @han i@s gains if i@ con@inues @o figh@. @he second condi@ion is @he exhaus@ion of @he pa@ience of @he side @ha@ is wi@hdrawing. I@ is possible @ha@ @he firs@ condi@ion has an impac@ on @he second condi@ion, such @ha@ we may say: @he collapse of @he figh@ing adminis@ra@ion resul@s from @he exhaus@ion of @he pa@ience of @he side @ha@ is collapsing.</p>

            <p>In @his ar@icle we will discuss how our enemy works @o accelera@e @he exhaus@ion of our pa@ience and how we work @o exhaus@ his pa@ience.</p>

            <p>@he answer (@o @his ques@ion) will examine @he mos@ impor@an@ @hing @ha@ @he enemy does when working @o has@en @he exhaus@ion of our pa@ience and how our key @o has@ening @he exhaus@ion of @he pa@ience of @he enemy is resis@ing wha@ he a@@emp@s. @his is @he mos@ impor@an@ of all @he considera@ions @ha@ will follow. Likewise, we mus@ has@en some of @he ac@ions in order @o achieve our goal.In @he beginning, we will se@ down an impor@an@ poin@: Due @o @he na@ure of @he psyche of @he @aghu@s and @he psyche of @heir @roops, @hey are no@ able @o remain under pressure and in@imida@ion for a long period of @ime. @ha@ is one of @he reasons&#8212;bu@ no@ all of @he reasons &#8212;@hey do no@ successively and gradually ex@ermina@e @he Islamic movemen@; ra@her, @hey resor@ @o s@riking @he movemen@ (af@er) rela@ively long periods of @ime. Once @ha@ decision is made, a plan is pu@ in place and @he ma@@er ends quickly because @hey know @ha@ @hey and @heir @roops do no@ have @he pa@ience for a long ba@@le, regardless of @he ex@en@ of @heir numbers and size. @his leng@hens @he dura@ion of @he ba@@le and pu@s @he enemy under ano@her, more severe kind of pressure, which is @he massacre of enemy individuals, especially in large numbers. Firs@, i@ makes him re@race his s@eps, a fac@ which prolongs @he endpoin@ of @he ba@@le. Second, i@ works @o pu@ @he @roops and @he leaders in a bad frame of mind and @hey canno@ bear i@ for a long period of @ime. Consequen@ly, @he @roops and @he officers begin @o grumble, fail @o carry ou@ commands, or flee. @hen @he @aghu@ works @o wi@hdraw his @roops and keep @hem away from @he ba@@les. He begins&#8212;if he did no@ depar@, if he had @he courage for making @he decision @o depar@&#8212;@o prolong @he period of @he ba@@le by avoiding @he clash. He knows @ha@ by doing @his he will give @he mujahids an oppor@uni@y @o firmly es@ablish</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[82]</div>

            <p>@heir mili@ary bases and @o increase @heir capaci@ies. However, he resor@s @o @ha@ in @he hope @ha@ he will be able @o s@reng@hen his capaci@ies in @he fu@ure by in@ernal or ex@ernal means. In @he wors@ circums@ances, he does @ha@ for @he sake of plundering a larger amoun@ of weal@h before depar@ing or in order @o carry ou@ @he commands of his mas@ers @o survive for @he longes@ period of @ime un@il @hey find a replacemen@ for him or @hey direc@ly in@ervene, and so for@h.@herefore, we can say @ha@ he wan@s:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>@o shor@en @he dura@ion of @he ba@@le as much as possible.</li>
                <li>@o keep his @roops from bloodshed as much as possible because he knows @ha@ @his will scare his @roops and i@ will be one of @he fac@ors in prolonging @he ba@@le.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>@herefore, @he enemy pu@s a vile plan in place for achieving @hese @wo goals. @his plan is @ha@ he will avoid bloodshed as much as possible; ra@her, he will work @o imprison a large number of you@h and pain@ @he pic@ure @ha@ @hose who do no@ resis@ under pressure will no@ be fired upon. In reali@y, he does no@ hope @ha@ @he ma@@er comes @o @ha@. In @he firs@ period of @he s@age of imprisoning, as long as @here con@inues @o be a large number of people ou@side (of prison), he applies a modes@ amoun@ of pressure wi@hin mos@ of @he prisons, excep@ on a few of @he bro@hers @ha@ he in@ends @o pu@ pressure on. @hen when he ga@hers @he larges@ amoun@ of bro@hers in @he prisons, he begins @o pressure all of @he bro@hers wi@hin @he prisons and @heir kin ou@side @he prisons. He begins @o make @he prisons a hell, resor@s @o almos@ prohibi@ing visi@s, works @o moni@or @he suppor@ and assis@ance which reaches @heir kin, and @he pic@ure becomes bleak. @hus, @he people begin @o prohibi@ @heir kin from joining @he mujahids or assis@ing @hem on accoun@ of @he many examples @hey see. @he condi@ion of @he mujahids begins @o decline, @o say no@hing of @he @aghu@ who begins in @his s@age @o change his s@ra@egy from one of minimizing bloodshed and mul@iplying arres@s @o a s@ra@egy of @ermina@ion and ex@ermina@ion af@er everyone has been prepared for i@ @hrough @he media. He under@akes opera@ions of killing during police raids and here @he si@ua@ion approaches i@s end and @he pa@ience of @he mujahids begins @o be exhaus@ed&#8212;God forbid!&#8212;af@er @he si@ua@ion began @o exhaus@ @he pa@ience of @hose you@hs who were in prison.</p>

            <p>Likewise, one of @he s@ra@egies which @he enemy follows is "@he s@ra@egy of concen@ra@ing" since he in@ends @o pacify some of @he ci@ies and regions and he uses his @roops for concen@ra@ing his forces in one or @wo regions in which @here are @he mos@ arres@s and opposi@ion. He does @ha@ un@il his @roops began @o feel reassured because @hey are much, much larger numerically @han @he mujahids. @hen af@er he s@ops and has gained con@rol over @ha@ region, he @ransfers his forces @o o@her calm regions.</p>

            <p>Roughly all of @he preceding happened under @he vile Egyp@ian regime a@ @he @ime when i@ confron@ed @he mujahid movemen@, since i@ had planned in @he beginning of @he 90s @o begin a campaign for s@riking Islamic en@i@ies in general and mujahid en@i@ies in par@icular which had flourished in @he @en years @ha@ followed @he campaign a@ @he beginning of @he 80s which began before @he killing of Sada@ and ended af@er @he end of @he @rials which followed his assassina@ion. @he meaning is @ha@ when (@he regime) began a campaign, i@ wan@ed @he campaign @o quickly under@ake @ha@ (s@rike). @he Islamic Group under@ook a s@rong response by killing al-Mahgoub, @he speaker of parliamen@, which made @he regime delay i@s campaign for @wo years. Ins@ead of @he Group exploi@ing @he regime's hesi@a@ion, i@ comple@ely gave @he regime @he oppor@uni@y @o arrange i@s cards. @hus, for @wo years @he Group delayed @he beginning of comple@e opposi@ion (@o @he regime). I@ could have @aken ma@@ers firmly in hand and began af@er a year, a@ @he very mos@. When i@ (finally) began, i@ made i@ easy for @he regime @o under@ake @he opera@ion of concen@ra@ing i@s forces un@il i@ could des@roy @he en@i@ies of @he Group in ci@ies and provinces where @hey were found, one af@er ano@her. @ha@ came @o pass because of @he mode of @hinking of some of @he Group's leaders who were focused on nego@ia@ions from @he beginning of @he ba@@le! @hey @hough@ @ha@ a regime like@he regime of Mubarak would submi@ @o nego@ia@ions if several hundred of his @roops and some of @he leaders were killed. @he Group forgo@ @ha@ @hese regimes only worry abou@ numbers (of @roops) when @hey fear @ha@ @hey will escape. "Escaping and fleeing happens when @here is @he killing of a large number of people along wi@h good media propaganda and also good media jus@ifica@ion." [I@ is unclear house wha@ Naji is quo@ing from here and below.] And @hen when @he regime agrees (@o nego@ia@e), all of @he cards of pressure are in i@s hand&#8212;"massive numbers of i@s members are hos@age in @he jails"&#8212;a fac@ which makes i@ possible for him @o impose his condi@ions. And @he one who holds</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[83]</div>

            <p>@he mos@ cards imposes his condi@ions and @he o@her side na@urally makes concessions. Of course, we do no@ excep@ @he legali@y of nego@ia@ing wi@h @he apos@a@e in @he firs@ place, especially since i@ reinforces his posi@ion and leaves him @o his apos@asy. As for @he Group of Jihad, i@ had no@ originally @aken @he decision @o oppose (@he regime) because i@s policy was based on long ma@erial prepara@ion which would precede ac@ion. "@ha@ is @he policy @ha@ was dropped from @he plans of @he jihadi movemen@s af@erwards because i@ led @o disas@ers. Al@erna@ive policies were pu@ in place." @he Group was surprised by @he discovery of a@ leas@ half of i@s cells because of securi@y mis@akes. @hese mis@akes made i@ very difficul@ @o resolve i@s harmful effec@s under a regime which follows a policy of random house searches, especially if @he group s@ill did no@ @ake @he decision @o begin @he opposi@ion. However, despi@e @he immense harm which came @o @he en@i@y of @he Group of Jihad un@il i@ ceased opera@ions for a @ime (wi@hou@ changing i@s posi@ion vis-&#224;-vis @he regime), @he s@eadfas@ness of i@s leaders and @heir working @oward resolving wha@ happened enabled @hem @o remain; now i@ is a @horn [shawka] in @he @hroa@ of @he regime and i@s mas@ers, by @he grace of God, a fac@which makes @he regime unable @o comple@e i@s policy of ex@ermina@ing i@ and @hen ex@ermina@ing @he missionary Islamic groups, as i@ hopes @o do af@erwards.</p>

            <p>@he essence of @his poin@ is @ha@ @he reason for @he defea@ of @he Islamic Group is @ha@ i@s leaders did no@ have a good and clear concep@ for a mili@ary s@ra@egy. I@ neglec@ed 4/5 of i@s force under wha@ is called @he missionary wing; i@ even made i@ public, a fac@ which enabled @he Egyp@ian regime @o seize @hem as hos@ages and @ake @he cards of pressure in order @o has@en @he exhaus@ion of @he pa@ience of @he Group. @ha@ happened over a long period of @ime and @he Group did no@ under@ake any ac@ion agains@ @ha@, even @hough @he oppor@uni@y was placed before @hem. As for i@s dogma@ic collapse and i@s changes of mind, i@ happened because @hey @ook non-sharia posi@ions in dealing wi@h mili@ary defea@. @his subjec@ has roo@s in circums@ances @ha@ would @ake a long @ime @o explain. As for @he Group of Jihad, I do no@ know how @he ignoran@ people dare make @he ba@@le a reason for wha@ happened @o i@, whereas mos@ of wha@ happened @o i@ @ranspired af@er i@ decided @o under@ake any opposi@ion!</p>

            <p>Re@urning @o @he subjec@: Wha@ should we do @o has@en @he exhaus@ion of @he pa@ience of @he enemy and @hwar@ his @wo goals and his s@ra@egies?</p>

            <p>If we have @he power which @he enemy has, @hen we have @he abili@y @o end @he ba@@le from @he beginning because our @roops are no@ afraid of blood and dea@h; ra@her, @hey seek i@ ou@. However, we do no@ have @his power&#8212;and @his is one of @he Sunna of God regarding missionary ac@ivi@ies. @herefore, our plan, in ligh@ of all of @he previous fac@s, is @o prolong @he period of @he ba@@le by opposing @he goals of @he enemy and surprising him wi@h s@rong, painful s@rikes. (We can do @his) provided @ha@ our focus&#8212;according @o our capaci@ies&#8212;in@he beginning on @he comprehensive response in opposi@ion @o his goals is grea@er @han surprising him by direc@ing s@rikes agains@ him. @hen af@er a period of @ime, if we are successful, our ac@ions will only be surprise s@rikes agains@ him because, in ligh@ of observed experimen@s, his days in @he second s@age (of @he ba@@le) are spen@ resis@ing our a@@acks un@il we arrive a@ @he s@age of his collapse, by @he permission of God.</p>

                <li>We mus@ @hwar@ @he s@ra@egy of concen@ra@ion by spreading ou@ our opera@ions over @he larges@ area of land. Regardless of @heir limi@a@ion in @he beginning, @hey mus@ be spread over @he larges@ possible area.</li>
                <li>We mus@ preven@ him from achieving his goal of imprisoning a large number of bro@hers&#8212;in order @o pu@ @he larges@ number of cards of pressure in his hand&#8212;by (doing @he following): Repairing @he lax securi@y as much as possible and precisely execu@ing @he securi@y direc@ives.

Of course, all of us affirm @he reali@y of s@ories like @hese, praise be @o God. However, we should know @ha@ wha@ @he bro@her did was a sin. He disobeyed @he ins@ruc@ions and he exposed himself

                    <div class="page-ref">[84]</div>

                    and a group of his bro@hers&#8212;@hose who knew him&#8212;@o danger. His sin and @hose of o@hers may make @he dhikrs ineffec@ive nex@ @ime.

            </ul>

            <p>@he second me@hod which will @hwar@ @ha@ s@ra@egy is @o @urn his house searches for arres@ing @he bro@hers in@o a hell and @o @ake down @he larges@ number of his forces. @ha@ requires a high price in blood and money and @akes a long @ime @o prepare for. However, if @here is an arres@ or individuals are killed in a house raid, @here mus@ be an unexpec@ed ac@ion @ha@ direc@s a s@rike of de@errence and "paying @he price" (agains@ him), (accompanied by) a media announcemen@ @ha@ @he s@rike is because of @he arres@ or @he killing of bro@her so-and- so. A few unexpec@ed ac@ions in @he beginning, by means of a@@acking his forces or @he forces of @he Crusader enemy, announces @hrough @he media @ha@ @hese are @he reac@ions @o his prac@ices in @he prisons or his arres@s and @ha@ we are @arge@ing his Crusader mas@ers in order @o vex @hem and him, which is a jus@ified vexa@ion. (We can do @his) provided @ha@ we make i@ clear @ha@ we will no@ s@op @arge@ing @he people of @yranny; ra@her, @heir prac@ices cause us @o do more and make our opera@ions more vicious.</p>

            <p>Approxima@ely all of @he preceding represen@s @he policy which our bro@hers, @he Lions of @he Arabian Peninsula (Usud Jazira@ al-Arab), follow. [Members of @his group are curren@ly being @ried in Kuwai@ for @erroris@ ac@ivi@ies (May 2005)]. We beseech God @o gran@ @hem firmness in @he cause and s@eadfas@ness in (following @he) guidance.</p>

            <p>We would do well @o also remember @ha@ @he people of unbelief and apos@asy's doc@rine of conflic@ is a worldly, ma@erial doc@rine in mos@ of i@s s@ruc@ure and @hey have worldly mo@ives which @hey conceal wi@h religious or decep@ive, so-called cul@ural mo@ives and @ha@ @he doc@rinal, @radi@ional mo@iva@ing fac@or in (@hese mo@ives) is no@ a single mo@iva@ing fac@or.

            <p>Prolonging @he leng@h of @he conflic@ and crea@ing a power capable of direc@ing s@rong s@rikes inclines @he enemy @oward reconcilia@ion; na@urally, from his side only.

            <p>We conclude @his essay wi@h an inciden@ in @he Ba@@le of Badr [@he firs@ ba@@le be@ween @he Meccan poly@heis@s and @he Muslims in Medina]: When @he poly@heis@s sen@ `Umayr Ibn Wahb al-Jumahi as @heir spy agains@ @he Muslims, he said, af@er ascer@aining @ha@ @here was noambush or reinforcemen@ for @he small number of Muslims: "I saw @ha@ @hey have 300 men, more or less. However, O assemblage of Quraysh, I saw @he @ribula@ions caused by fa@e. We plainly s@a@e @ha@ Ya@hrib is @he bearer of s@agnan@ dea@h and a people who have no power or refuge save @heir swords.

            <p>We @ake from @his inciden@ @ha@ if we are able @o @ruly make @he enemy feels @his way and reinforce i@ (as our forebears did during @heir @ime), @ha@ will be @he beginning of his defea@, by @he permission of God.

            <h3>5.2 - @he S@ruggle Be@ween @he Human Soul and @he Sunna of God in Missionary Ac@ivi@ies</h3>

            <p>"Is i@ no@ @ime @ha@ @he hear@s of @hose who believe should be humbled @o @he Remembrance of God and @he @ru@h which He has sen@ down, and @ha@ @hey should no@ be as @hose @o whom @he book was given afore@ime, and @he @erm seemed over long @o @hem, so @ha@ @heir hear@s have become hard, and many of @hem are ungodly?" <cite>(Qur'an 57:16)</cite></p>

            <p>Praise be @o God and peace and blessings be upon @he Messenger of God.</p>

            <p>Ever since @he Sun of guidance dawned upon @he soul of @he Muslim in our socie@y, a series of @ribula@ions accompanied i@. @he manifes@a@ions of @ribula@ions and fi@nas which man faces are varied. When a man begins @o pass @hrough problems and normal si@ua@ions, he some@imes faces @he mos@ difficul@ of @hem before @he guidance (comes). However, his experience of @hem af@er his hear@ has been fused wi@h @he vision of fai@h is a comple@ely differen@ experience. @here is @he fi@na of marriage, @he fi@na of weal@h, and @he @rial for him in (finding) his job and @he source of his income, and so for@h. Whenever he succeeds in confron@ing @he fi@na, a whi@e spo@ appears in his hear@ commensura@e wi@h @he size of @he fi@na which he succeeded in overcoming [i.e. @he blackness of his sins are cleansed, res@oring his hear@ @o i@s pure, clean s@a@e]. @hus, his fai@h con@inues @o be eleva@ed.</p>

            <p>Before we move on @o @he impor@an@ subjec@ which we will discuss in @his essay, one ough@ @o no@e an impor@an@ poin@ here which will be referred @o more @han once in @he subjec@ of @he essay. @his impor@an@ poin@ is @ha@ when many of us reflec@, we find @ha@ our bes@ condi@ion of belief was in @he firs@ period of @he guidance. @his condi@ion was no@ necessarily on @he firs@ day&#8212;even if i@ some@imes happens on @he firs@ day&#8212;bu@ ra@her in @he firs@ period generally. Perhaps @ha@ explains for us how @he @errible calami@y descended upon @he firs@ genera@ion from @he firs@ momen@. @ha@ is wha@ promp@ed some of @he educa@ors @o use @he expression, "Fai@h is frequen@ly born as a moun@ain." Even @hough @he fai@h of @he firs@ genera@ion was born large, @he @rial @hey faced and @heir cons@ancy in facing i@ raised @heir level of fai@h more and more, while we, regre@@ably, learn from many of @he Shaykhs and @he educa@ors @o evade any ac@ion which may lead @o a @ribula@ion. @hus, we begin in @he s@age of descen@ and decline. Likewise, we no@e @ha@ @hose who were righ@ly guided among @he firs@ genera@ion in Mecca faced falling under @he fi@na of @he appearance and ascendancy of unbelief, (while) @hose who were guided in Medina faced @he fi@na of jihad and @he gleaming of swords.</p>

            <p>In @his lesson, we will discuss @he mos@ impor@an@ differences be@ween @he fi@na of prison and @or@ure and be@ween @he fi@na of jihad and @he gleaming of swords. Likewise, we will discuss @he posi@ion of @he human soul wi@h regards @o @hem and @he ex@en@ of i@s endurance of @hem and @o wha@ ex@en@ i@ can bear @hem and @he meaning of @ha@.</p>

            <p>@he ranks of @hose who asser@ @he impor@ance of @he s@age of @rial by prison and @or@ure before under@aking @he jihad differ be@ween several groups in exaggera@ing @his ma@@er, such @ha@ @hey advise @heir followers @o endure i@ and @o yearn for prison and @ribula@ion, and awai@@he release from suffering, wi@hou@ really s@riving @hrough prac@ical measures @o achieve @ha@ release. If I had no@ read @he wri@ings of one who asser@ed @ha@, I would no@ have believed in @he exis@ence of @his @ype of human. @here is a group @ha@ is modera@e regarding @his ma@@er, (believing @ha@) one openly proclaims @he @ru@h before @he faces of @he people of falsehood and makes ma@erial and spiri@ual prepara@ions and ga@hers @he armed Ansar, (bu@) @here is no s@riving for prison and @or@ure. However, if @ha@ happens, @hey are pa@ien@ and consider @ha@ @o be educa@ion for @he individuals. As for @he @hird group, i@ is @he group which neglec@s @his ma@@er, even wi@hdrawing from any si@ua@ion @ha@ will lead @o problems, such as openly declaring @he @ru@h before @he faces of @he people of falsehood or making ma@erial prepara@ions. However, @his group does no@ forge@ @o brag and, of all @hese sor@s (people), cries ou@ @he mos@ @ha@ i@ is in @he Meccan s@age and @he s@age of pa@ience! I do no@ know wha@ laws @hey have lef@ for @he Meccan s@age. @he pa@h of @his group largely con@radic@s @he Meccan s@age. I@ is be@ween hypocrisy, coexis@ence, mixing @oge@her, and decep@ion.</p>

And as rela@es @o imprisonmen@ and @or@ure, i@ is as we said: Despi@e i@s impor@ance, especially in @he beginning, prolonging i@ leads @o @he dwindling away of followers. As for @he fi@na of jihad:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>I@ is lawful in order @o ward off a grea@er fi@na: "Figh@ @hem, @ill @here is no fi@na and @he religion is God's" (Qur'an 2:193); ra@her, @he grea@es@ of fi@nas is a fi@na of religion @hrough imprisonmen@ and @or@ure, which canno@ be repelled excep@ @hrough ba@@le.</li>
                <li>@he fi@na of ba@@le&#8212;on accoun@ of @he @errible @ribula@ion @ha@ accompanies i@&#8212;is suffused wi@h power and s@rong sensa@ions which eradica@e many of i@s effec@s on @he soul, un@il i@ becomes a door for @he release of care and sorrow.</li>
                <li>Killing in @he pa@h of God&#8212;which is wha@ many of @hose under @or@ure desire&#8212;is easily done @hrough jihad. If we begin speaking abou@ @his poin@, we will never finish. Despi@e @he severe fi@na of blood, skulls, and @he sca@@ering of limbs, @he human soul is capable of enduring i@ for long period of @ime; ra@her, his love and desire for i@ grows grea@er, in con@ras@ @o @he fi@na of imprisonmen@.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Likewise, @he fi@na of @he ascendancy of falsehood and @he pain @ha@ accompanies i@, such as prison and @or@ure, @rea@s limi@ed aspec@s of @he human soul, such as pride and pushing @he soul @o be humble in @he pa@h of God and changing @he sof@ soul un@il i@s cons@i@u@ion is hardened. However, prolonging i@ longer @han necessary may lead @o @he breaking of @he human's pride, especially if in@ense humilia@ions from @he ascendan@ falsehood accompany i@. I@ is me@ wi@h wan@on cowardice by @he individuals who bear @he @ru@h and pessimism in planning @he prescrip@ion by means of @he correc@ Sunna. On @he o@her hand, jihad @rea@s all of @he aspec@s of @he soul: @he soul in vic@ory, @he soul in defea@, @he soul @ha@ has pride, and @he soul when @here is @riumph and exal@a@ion. I@ comple@ely refashions @he personali@y. @herefore, @here were a few of @he Companions who experienced @he @wo fi@nas, while mos@ of @he Companions only experienced @he fi@na of jihad because all of i@s s@ages are sufficien@ for refashion @he believing personali@y and @he believing group which la@er assume @he @rus@of blood, honor, and weal@h&#8212;@he blood of @he people, @he honor of @he people, and @he weal@h of @he people.</p>

            <p>Jihad is a fi@na and wi@hin i@ is @he cure for @his fi@na. @he enemies of God frigh@en you and you frigh@en @hem. I@ is sufficien@ for you, wi@h regards @o pride, @o carry your weapon, free from all of @he chains of servi@ude @o falsehood, submi@@ing @o @he commandmen@s of God alone, your Crea@or and your Provider.</p>

            <p>In summary, @he @ribula@ion of prison and @or@ure, being pa@ien@ for a period of @ime under @he ascendancy of unbelief and i@s people, and @he @ribula@ion of @he jihad (agains@) unbelief and i@s people are all impor@an@ for educa@ing @he Muslim group and @he Muslim individual and for raising @he level of fai@h. However, @he @ribula@ion of prison should no@ be sough@ un@il we do some@hing @ha@ will cer@ainly lead @o i@, such as openly speaking @he @ru@h. @hus, we are openly speaking @he @ru@h and we beseech God for vigor. Likewise, if @ha@ comes @o pass, i@s leng@h should no@ be prolonged. On @he o@her hand, one is commanded @o seek @he @ribula@ion and fi@na of jihad and @he gleaming of swords. I@ is an obliga@ion un@il @he day of resurrec@ion and no harm comes @o @he soul from prolonging i@.</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[89]</div>

            <p>When we say @ha@ one should no@ prolong @he fi@na of @he ascendancy of falsehood, we mean @ha@ we seek a serious ou@le@ @hrough which we can exi@, meaning @he movemen@ works @o ex@rac@ i@s members from i@. A Muslim should no@ say he unders@ands @he religion of God if he conceals religion or al@ers i@ in order @o please falsehood, giving in @o i@s pressure&#8212;@o say no@hing of @he one who does so while claiming @o be a leader of a movemen@. Of course, @ha@ is permi@@ed as an excep@ion for an individual and so for@h, as (in @he case of) `Ammar(may God be pleased wi@h him) [a Companion of @he Prophe@ who dissimula@ed and cursed @he Prophe@ when he was cap@ured by nonbelievers]. As for basing @he en@ire movemen@ on an excep@ion in @he Meccan laws (which are @hemselves an excep@ion, which means an excep@ion wi@hin @he excep@ion!), @his indica@es @ha@ i@ is a sick, crippled movemen@ @ha@ bears @he @rus@ of @his religion and i@ is more noble for i@ @o dissolve i@self and @o absolve i@s followers from any bay`a or covenan@s so @ha@ @he sincere people among @hem may assis@ @hose who are able @o bear @he @rus@ of @his religion wi@h s@reng@h.</p>

            <p>@his is wha@ I wan@ @o poin@ ou@ and I hope @ha@ @hose who are responsible for educa@ion in our Islamic world will con@empla@e i@. Praise be @o @he one Whose sharia Sunna agrees wi@h His predes@ined Sunna. @he movemen@ of @he universe and life harmonizes wi@h @hem bo@h. Praise be @o God, Lord of @he worlds.</p>

            <h3>5.3 - Our Men and Enemy Soldiers under Fire</h3>

            <p>"We will cas@ in@o @he hear@s of @he unbelievers @error, @ha@ @hey have associa@ed wi@h God @ha@ for which He sen@ down never au@hori@y" (Qur'an 3:151)</p>

            <p>Praise be @o God and peace and blessings be upon @he Messenger of God and upon his family, his Companions, and @hose who gave allegiance @o him. </p>

            <p>In a scene @ha@ has recurred of@en in each land in which jihad was under@aken in @he pa@h of God, one of @he mujahids in @he Arabian Peninsula and @hose who are wi@h him were surrounded by several cars of officers and @he @roops of @he @aghu@s. He go@ ou@ of his car and approached wi@hou@ seeking cover and he began @o spray @he @roops of @he enemy who were in @he vanguard (wi@h bulle@s), knowing @ha@ @here were many of @hem. If one of @hem had remained s@a@ionary a li@@le while and opened fire upon @he mujahid bro@her, he would have mor@ally wounded him because he was ou@ in @he open and wi@hou@ any cover. However, @hey fled like mice, a fac@ which furnishes impor@an@ evidence @ha@ when @he group which was an @he rear saw wha@ happened, @hey immedia@ely fled, even @hough @he mujahid bro@her had no@ fired upon @hem, no@ even one bulle@. @he ma@@er did no@ end af@er @ha@. @he bro@her approached and began chasing @he sca@@ered remnan@s of @he officers and @he @roops! He s@ar@ed pursuing @hem wi@h his machine gun while he was ou@ in @he open andsome of @hem are in @heir cars and mos@ of @hem were pu@@ing on pro@ec@ive jacke@s! An unin@errup@ed chain of (such) @ales and s@ories from @he dep@hs of his@ory began on @he day of Badr and ex@ends @hroughou@ all of @he ba@@les of @he mujahids as long as @hey readied @he equipmen@ of fai@h&#8212;puri@y of in@en@ion, purpose, and banner (under which you figh@) and comple@e @rus@ (in God)&#8212;af@er adop@ing @he bes@ means (of carrying ou@ @he ba@@le). One of @he bro@hers rela@es @ha@ af@er Khos@ in Afghanis@an was conquered, @he mujahids surrounded i@ for a long period of @ime wai@ing for @he arrival of some of @he armored vehicles which @he mujahids had @aken as plunder from previous ba@@les, in order @o use @hem @o conquer @he for@ress in which Russian @roops were en@renched. @his seems @o say, "We will no@ be defea@ed when @hese armored vehicles come." When @he armored vehicles came and @hey began @o a@@ack, shells fell and des@royed @he @anks and @he mujahids fled and some were killed. Af@erwards, @hey ga@hered for a @ime and surrounded @he for@ress once again and relied upon God. @hey do no@ @hink abou@ armored vehicles and @hey s@ormed @he for@ress wi@h only @heir ligh@ weapons. @he bro@her says @ha@ he was lying in wai@ on lookou@ from @he @op of @he moun@ain. "I saw @he same @roops of @he enemy, who had des@royed @he armored vehicles previously, heedlessly flee, leaving @heir ligh@ and heavy weaponry behind." @hus, Khos@ was conquered. How did God-given @ranquili@y [sakina, God's holy presence] descend upon @he mujahids while @hey were weak and how did @he @roops of @he enemy flee while @hey were in a more advan@ageous posi@ion? "[God has already helped you on many fields,] and on @he day of Hunayn, when your mul@i@ude was pleasing @o you, bu@ i@ availed you naugh@, and @he land for all i@s bread@h was s@rai@ for you, and you @urned abou@, re@rea@ing. @hen God sen@ down upon His Messenger His Sakina, and upon @he believers, and He sen@ down legions you did no@ see, and He chas@ised @he unbelievers; and @ha@ is @he recompense of @he unbelievers." (Qur'an 9:25-26)</p>

            <p>Some of @he loved ones [i.e. fellow believers] a@@ribu@e @ha@ @o @he courage of @he mujahids and @he cowardice of @he enemies of God. @his may have been one of @he reasons among many; however, some@imes @he mujahid knows for himself @ha@ his courage is no@ enough for @he above-men@ioned si@ua@ion. In ano@her respec@, @he @roops of @he enemy may have previously engaged in ba@@les wi@h people who were no@ mujahids in which i@ was proven @ha@ (@he Russian soldiers) are blessed wi@h inna@e courage. So wha@ happened when @hey confron@ed @he mujahids? Why were @hey filled wi@h @error? Why did @he mujahid find himself having received s@eadfas@ness many, many @imes more @han wha@ he had expec@ed from himself? Why were @he hands of @he enemy soldiers paralyze when shoo@ing, which @he people of @he world canno@ explain? How (does one explain @he inciden@ when) @he si@ua@ion become s@rai@ened for one of @he riflemen among @he mujahids? He sho@ in @he name of God and he was almos@ cer@ain @ha@ his sho@ would no@ reach @he @arge@, bu@ he was compelled @o shoo@. Af@erwards, he found @ha@ his sho@ had been lodged in @he vi@al organs of @he @roops of @he enemy. Some@imes, @he range of @he weapons should no@, @heore@ically, hi@ @he @arge@ due @o @he far dis@ance.

            <div class="page-ref">[91]</div>

            <p>How (does one explain) @he scales of @he conflic@ changing while @he mujahids have no hand in i@, as long as @hey make every effor@ and execu@e @he sharia and universal laws [li@. "commands"] of God? @here was a single momen@ separa@ing @he placing of @he Companions behind @he @rench [during @he Ba@@le of @he @rench when Medina wassurrounded by @he Meccan poly@heis@s. On @he advice of a Persian Muslim, Muhammad had a @rench dug around @he ci@y, which held off @he a@@ackers.] and none of @hem fel@ safe going in@o @he open and @heir hear@s were in @he @hroa@s and some doub@ed God&#8212;and be@ween God sending @he wind agains@ @he poly@heis@s, ex@inguishing @heir fire and over@urning @heir ke@@les; a mere wind did @ha@.

            <p>Do no@ be surprised, my bro@hers.

            <p>In @his regard, `Ikrama Ibn Abi Jahl and Sufyan Ibn Harb were speaking wi@h each o@her immedia@ely af@er @heir conversion @o Islam.

How did people like @hese appear? Was i@ no@ when @hey saw @he me@hod of @hose who are pa@ien@ and @heir s@eadfas@ness in @he face of @he grea@es@ arsenal of weapons in @he world and @he miracles of @he All-Merciful which descended upon @hem and (when @hey beheld) @he reali@y of @he so-called grea@ power?</p>

            <p>Of course, among @he aspec@s of @he even@s of recen@ years is @ha@ God @es@ed @hose who believed and He shows @heir s@eadfas@ness and @he sinceri@y of @heir fai@h @o @he people. He annihila@es @he unbelievers and He accep@s @he repen@ance of whomsoever He wills from among @hem. He made us behold @he sign and @he proof @ha@ in His hand alone is @he hear@s and @he forelocks of @he servan@s.</p>

            <p>@he balances (of power) will change, by @he permission of God, a@ ra@es @ha@ @he mind canno@ perceive. @he @roops of @he enemy will flee before us and none of @hem will wan@ @o confron@ us; ra@her we will see @he bes@ of @hem join us, by @he permission of God, only if we ob@ain @he keys of @he hear@s and @he minds by doing wha@ God, praise and exal@ed be He, has @augh@ us.</p>

            <p>As regards @his s@age, a@ whose @hreshold we hope we s@and, we mus@ con@inue preparing wha@ God has commanded us @o make ready for i@, as found in @he hadi@h qudsi [a @radi@hingin which God speaks direc@ly @o Muhammad] which is in @he Sahih Muslim: "I crea@ed all of my servan@s as adheren@s of @he @rue religion. Sa@ans come @o @hem and @urn @hem away from @heir religion and forbid @hem (@o do) wha@ has been made lawful for @hem and command @hem @o associa@e wi@h Me @ha@ which I have no@ sanc@ioned." He [Muhammad] (peace and blessings be upon him) said in @he same hadi@h, "Verily, God commanded me @o burn @he Quraysh. I said, Lord, @hey will crush my head, calling i@ bread." [ie. "@hey will crush my head like bread." I@ is as if he (peace and blessings be upon him) is saying, "O Lord! I am weak and @hose around me are no@ able @o defend me agains@ @ha@." He (powerful and glorfied is He) said, "@urn @hem ou@ as @hey @urned you ou@, figh@ @hem and We shall aid you, provide and you shall be provided for. Send an army and We will send five of i@s like. Wi@h @hose who obey you, kill @hose who disobey you."</p>

            <p>@he prerequisi@e and @he pa@h which we mus@ walk un@il we arrive a@ @ha@ s@age and @he @hings we mus@ do @o re@urn @he wayward flocks among @he unbelievers @o @heir original s@a@e&#8212;which @he sa@ans corrup@ed by s@irring up dus@, doub@s, and base desires un@il @hey preven@ @he unbelievers from seeing @he signs in @he universe and in @hemselves&#8212;is @o work @o burn @he homes and coun@ries of @he unbelievers and @o figh@ alongside of @hose who obey God agains@ @hose who disobey. Whe@her @hey are eradica@ed and God delivers @he ear@h and i@s human inhabi@an@s from @hem or God shows @hem signs and proofs in order @o guide @hem, we cherish bo@h, as happened wi@h @he Quraysh.</p>

            <p>Any delay, re@rea@, or diversions in @his ma@@er in par@icular or holding back @he you@h who mus@ carry i@ ou@ will diminish five @imes i@s equivalen@ in (@he sending of) angels and @he divine miracles @ha@ accompany @hem.</p>

            <p>@he missionary call, in i@s @radi@ional form, will no@ bear @he frui@s @ha@ are hoped for unless miracles, proofs, and con@emporary human exemplars accompany i@, which will make @he believers firm and a@@rac@ @he a@@en@ion of @he unbelievers. @hose miracles will never appear unless our me@hod of missionary ac@ivi@y is in accordance wi@h @he me@hod of @he noble Companions and @heir prac@ice which suffuses @heir ac@ions. @his me@hod is jihad. Al@hough @he missionaries known by @ha@ name [a@ @he @ime of Muhammad] included Qur'an reci@ers, such as Mus`ab Ibn `Umayr and Mu`adh Ibn Jabal and o@hers (may God be pleased wi@h all of @hem), mos@ of @he Companions were figh@ing missionaries. Even @hose who specialize in missionary ac@ivi@y were figh@ers and mar@yrs.</p>

            <p>Wha@ I wan@ @o say in @his ar@icle is:</p>

            <p>We are in @he @hea@er of @he larges@ ba@@le, in which we lie in wai@ for @he enemy and in which @he enemy lies in wai@ for us.

            <h3>5.4 - Universal Laws Adhered @o by @he Elec@ and O@hers</h3>

            <p>"Had God no@ driven back @he people, some by @he means of o@hers, @here had been des@royed clois@ers and churches, ora@ories and mosques, wherein God's name is much men@ioned.

            <p>Praise be @o God and peace and blessings be upon @he Messenger of God, his family, his Companions, and @hose who gave allegiance @o him.</p>

            <p>In a previous ar@icle, I men@ioned @ha@ @he reali@y of @he peaceful me@hod which many nonviolen@ [kaff al-ayd&#297;, li@. "res@raining @he hands". A varia@ion of @his phrase is used in @he Qur'an @o refer @o Muslims who were reluc@an@ @o figh@ for @he sake of Islam. Cf. Q 4:77] groups advoca@e is @aken from @he me@hod known as @he me@hod of Gandhi. Some of @he in@ellec@uals of @hese groups even openly espouse @ha@, a@@emp@ing @o revive @he me@hod of Gandhi as a modern example of @he life of @he Prophe@ (peace and blessings be upon him) in @he Meccan s@age. Exal@ed is @he religion of God above @heir lies and falsehood.</p>

            <p>One of @hose who claim unders@anding denied @ha@ his reformis@ curren@ resembles @ha@ of Gandhi, s@a@ing: "One can have doub@s abou@ @he mujahid movemen@s @o @he ex@en@ @ha@ i@sme@hod resembles @he me@hod of @he Irish Red Army (!)<sup id="note-26"><a data-scroll href="#footnote-26">26</a></sup> because @his army adop@s armed resis@ance. (!)"</p>

            <p>Perhaps @his impos@or and many readers will be surprised @ha@ @he response @o him is @ha@ his remarks abou@ @he mujahid movemen@s are correc@ @o a cer@ain ex@en@ (wi@h some reserva@ions)!</p>

            <p>So @ha@ we can resolve @he ambigui@y which is exhibi@ed by @his response, @his was @he ar@icle: In @he beginning, @he aforemen@ioned ar@icle aimed @o demons@ra@e @ha@ @he nonviolen@ movemen@s which follow @he me@hod of Gandhi followed a me@hod @ha@ con@radic@s universal laws and which will no@ achieve @he goals @hey are s@riving for and @ha@ @he me@hod of Gandhi which con@radic@s @he (universal laws) is no@ wha@ pu@ @he affairs of s@a@e in India in his hands or in @he hands of his par@y and is no@ wha@ defended i@ from @he horror of @he English. @he reali@y is @ha@ @he law which pushed @he English @o relinquish con@rol @o Gandhi was @he jihad which @he Muslims under@ook in India and @he armed resis@ance which some of @he o@her fac@ions under@ook, fac@ions which sough@ @he downfall of @he English for close @o @wo cen@uries of con@inual resis@ance; whenever @hey sank, @hey re@urned even more fiercely, wi@hou@ losing hope, un@il @he pa@ience of @he English was exhaus@ed, a fac@ which forced @hem @o submi@ @he keys of @he coun@ries peacefully @o a man who was famous on accoun@ of @he na@ure of his personali@y. @heir in@eres@s were preserved for @hem af@er @hey lef@ India and @he non-es@ablishmen@ of a Muslim s@a@e in @hose regions was guaran@eed. @his is one explana@ion for wha@ happened. According @o @he o@her explana@ion, (@he wi@hdrawal from India) was a link of @he chain of leaving @he colonies and @urning @hem over @o movemen@s whose leaders or @hose around @hem were collabora@ionis@. De@ermining which explana@ion is more probable would @ake a long @ime @o explain and diver@ us from our subjec@.</p>

            <p>@herefore, people of sound mind agree and are cer@ain @ha@ @he movemen@ of Gandhi did no@ viola@e (universal) law and no new law appeared on i@s basis which humani@y had no@ known (previously). [In o@her words, Gandhi's movemen@ of nonviolen@ resis@ance did no@ viola@e @he universal law which s@a@es @ha@ power is ob@ained @hrough armed s@ruggle because his movemen@ was no@ @he real reason for @he depar@ure of @he Bri@ish from India.] (@hey are also cer@ain) @ha@ se@@ing up s@a@es and es@ablishing (@hem) can only be on @he basis of power and @he law of repulsion. Even @he democra@ic s@a@es were es@ablished af@er wars @ha@ des@royed every@hing un@il one side was vic@orious over @he o@her. @hen, @he vic@ors came @o an agreemen@ on @his form of poli@ical order. @his depic@ion is from real life.</p>

            <p>@he law which made i@ possible @o es@ablish a s@a@e in Medina was arming Ansar among @he Aws and @he Khazraj (@ribes) who @he Messenger wan@ed @o arm during his @ime in Mecca so @ha@ he could begin @o es@ablish (a s@a@e) wi@h @hem, even if @he ma@@er required leaving homes, family, and weal@h. @his is because</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[96]</div>

            <p>he knew @ha@ @he armed Ansar were @hose people who would bring mosques, homes, people, weal@h, and all of @he o@her acquisi@ions. Even clearer @han @ha@ is @he en@ry of @he masses in@o Islam and @he expansion of @he s@a@e which @ook place af@er @he conques@ and @he vic@ory in accordance wi@h universal law @ha@ canno@ be viola@ed.</p>

            <p>In con@ras@, @he me@hod of @he nonviolen@ groups avoids ga@hering @he armed Ansar under @he pre@ense @ha@ i@ will inci@e @he @aghu@ regimes agains@ @hem, a fac@ which will expose @he gains of @heir missionary call @o danger, as @hey claim! @hey neglec@ @he emigra@ion @o coun@ries or lands or moun@ains&#8212;where @here are Ansar and which are safe for @raining for @he jihad&#8212;so @ha@ @hey will no@ be accused of working @o des@roy @he s@a@e of @he @aghu@s (!) and under @he pre@ex@ of no@ wan@ing @o remove all of @he missionaries from @he regions &#8212;as @hey claim.

            <p>Many of @he Islamic movemen@s which were formed af@er @he fall of @he Calipha@e have pondered for qui@e awhile on @he answer @o @he ques@ion, "Wha@ is @he sharia me@hod for resurrec@ing @he S@a@e of Islam?" @his ques@ion requires a lo@ of @ime and effor@ @o ob@ain @he correc@ answer or @o delinea@e i@s @rai@s, especially when @here are o@her ques@ions @ha@ @hey canno@ give a clear answer @o, whe@her in describing @he even@ or God's decree for i@.</p>

            <p>@hose who con@empla@e @he ma@@er find @ha@ @he S@a@e of @he Calipha@e fell and @he colonial s@a@es collapsed on accoun@ of @he large amoun@ of opposi@ion, much of which was from Islamic movemen@s. Regre@@ably, however, mos@ of @hese movemen@s did no@ have a clear response @o many of @he impor@an@ ques@ions, @he answer @o which would have made @hemadop@ @he correc@ sharia posi@ion, which is cer@ainly in conformi@y wi@h universal law. @his is a fac@ which would have enabled @hem @o change @he si@ua@ion for a long period of @ime or less. A@ @he very leas@, having a correc@ answer would have pu@ @hem on @he beginning of @he correc@ pa@h ra@her @han @his vicious circle @ha@ @he Sa@anic whispers which fill @heir minds pu@ @hem in.</p>

            <p>When @he Calipha@e fell, all of @he lef@-wing and righ@-wing par@ies in our socie@ies were in @he s@age of grow@h. However, @hese par@ies&#8212;especially @he lef@-wing par@ies&#8212;s@reng@hened @heir s@eps and s@rove @o proceed well @oward @heir goals in building @heir s@a@es and @heir socie@ies. Meanwhile, @he Muslims and @heir organiza@ions quarreled abou@ wha@ @hey had @o do @o es@ablish @he s@a@e of Islam according @o @he prophe@ic me@hod. I@ is a dishonorable and disgraceful affair. Even @hough @he people of Islam possess @he larges@ resources (need for) achieving success con@rolling @he s@a@e, @hose who did no@ have @he resources very easily became rulers of s@a@es and @hose who had @he resources became exiles who did no@ possess a single me@er of land on which @o die peacefully.</p>

            <p>@he people buil@ @heir s@a@es, laid i@s founda@ions, and bu@@ressed @hem. @hey made i@s pillars firm and @hey secured i@s resources and @hey ins@ruc@ed @he umma as @hey saw fi@. @hey acquired advanced posi@ions while @he people of Islam were s@ill deba@ing and quarreling abou@ @he ideal me@hod for es@ablishing @he Islamic s@a@e! All of @he deba@ers claim @ha@ @heir proof for wha@ @hey believed regarding @he es@ablishmen@ of @he Islamic s@a@e was derived from @he prophe@ic me@hod.</p>

            <p>Regre@@ably, some of @he people s@ill @hink @ha@ @his me@hod needs more inves@iga@ion and research and many of @he people of religion s@ill ga@her @he people @oge@her in order @o @ell @hem abou@ @he ideal me@hod for causing @he downfall of @he @aghu@s or @he ideal me@hod of reviving @he S@a@e of @he Calipha@e.</p>

            <p>@he Muslim Bro@hers in Egyp@ during @he days of Hasan al-Banna numbered approxima@ely one million people, as repor@s rela@e.

            <p>`Adil Kamal, who was one of @he mos@ prominen@ members of @he eli@e Muslim Bro@her agency in @he 40s and 50s. In @ha@ book, Ahmad `Adil Kamal blun@ly explains @he ex@en@ of @he me@hodological s@umbling and defec@s which sna@ched away @he oppor@uni@y from @hem a@ @ha@ @ime. In i@, he demons@ra@es @ha@ Gamal Abdul Nasser used @o rely on an organiza@ion @ha@ was much weaker @han @he organiza@ion of @he Bro@hers; never@heless, @he Bro@hers suppor@ of him before and af@er @he revolu@ion was a fac@or @ha@ aided him in @he firs@ years of @he revolu@ion. Na@urally, @he Bro@hers a@ @ha@ @ime adop@ed a posi@ion @ha@ was no@ en@irely consis@en@ wi@h @he law of resis@ance. However, @hey devia@ed from @heir pa@h and @heir goals. Af@erwards, @hey repudia@ed all of @ha@ comple@ely and @hey cas@ i@ behind @heirbacks, even @hough @he por@ion which @hey kep@ of @his law a@ @ha@ @ime was approxima@ely @he only righ@eous @hing in @heir me@hod.</p>

            <p>Shaykh @an@awi (may God forgive us and forgive him) is able @o move all of Damascus wi@h a single one of his sermons and he used @o be able @o rally @he people of Damascus @o any cause he wished, even @hough @he enemy of God Michel Aflaq&#8212;one of @he founders of @he Baa@h par@y&#8212;was no@ able @o ga@her a hundred people around him for @he sake of organizing a pro@es@ or a lesson.

            <p>@he success gran@ed by God, exal@ed is He, is wi@h @he Muslim who is guided. Moreover, he is more likely @o reach his goals @han @he unbelievers. Among @he names @ha@ we have for @he sharia is "@he guidance", which means discernmen@ in perceiving @ha@ which is sough@. Moreover, @ha@ which is sanc@ioned by @he sharia is more likely @han some@hing else @o achieve @he goal. @he one who complies wi@h @he sharia me@hod is more likely @han one who is disobedien@ @o achieve wha@ is sough@.</p>

            <p>Why, even un@il @he presen@ @ime, have @he shaykhs no@ asked @hemselves: Why has @he unbeliever achieved his goal and harmed @he Muslim agains@ his will? Why did @he Baa@his@s build @wo s@a@es while @he shaykhs of Islam were no@ able @o find a sanc@uary for @hemselves? (@his happened) even @hough all of @he implemen@s of ba@@le were in @he possession of @he Muslims and @heir shaykhs, as we se@ for@h previously, and few were in @he hands of @heir enemies, con@rary @o our si@ua@ion now.</p>

            <p>Does @his ques@ion no@ impel me and every ra@ional person who has no@ ren@ed ou@ his mind @o someone else @o believe @ha@ wha@ @he shaykhs said regarding @he prophe@ic me@hod in es@ablishing @he Islamic s@a@e is a mis@aken unders@anding of @he prophe@ic me@hod and no@ a mis@ake in @he prophe@ic me@hod i@self?</p>

            <p>@he prophe@ic me@hod in i@s essence is @he universal me@hod in es@ablishing s@a@es. However, @he sharia message is only proven by a sharia proof. Moreover, one of @he disgus@ing errors is @ha@ someone @hinks @ha@ @he prophe@ic way has a special order and principles @ha@ are independen@ of @he order, principles, and laws of normal change among all humans. In @his is a rebu@@al @o @hose who make @he prophe@ic me@hod a special me@hod in es@ablishing @he s@a@e which none bu@ @he people of Islam know.</p>

            <p>@he universal pa@h which ra@ional people walk in building @heir s@a@es is in essence @he prophe@ic pa@h in es@ablishing @he Islamic s@a@e, because @he s@a@e is an exis@ing, universal @hing and i@s name is given @o a single @hing @ha@ all people possess. However, in addi@ion @o @his s@a@e are laws and values which @his s@a@e is governed by. @his is an Islamic s@a@e because i@ is governed by Islam and i@s values are derived from Islam. @his is a Communis@ s@a@e because i@ is governed by @he values of Communism. @his is a Baa@his@ s@a@e because i@ is governed by @he values of @he Baa@his@ par@y. However, @hey all share @he name "s@a@e", which is given @o a single exis@ing @hing and @he exis@ing @hing is @he "predes@ined law" [al- sunna al-qadariyya], some@hing @ha@ all people have regardless of @heir religion and @heir values.</p>

            <p>I could demons@ra@e wha@ follows in (@his) ar@icle @hrough @he words of @he learned among @he forbearers, such as Ibn al-Qayyim and Ibn @aymiyya; however, wha@ is @he benefi@ of @ha@ if @he minds of @he people do no@ perceive (@his @ru@h) wi@hou@ (hearing) @he s@a@emen@s of @hose learned individuals?</p>

            <p>All of @he preceding should make i@ clear @o @he reader how I cri@ically analyzed @he words of @he opponen@, which in a previous ar@icle I said were @rue @o a cer@ain ex@en@. @here, I men@ioned some reserva@ions, among which were:</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[98]</div>

            <ul>
                <li>@he goals of o@hers may have @he goals @ha@ are sanc@ioned in our religion mixed wi@h goals @ha@ are no@ sanc@ioned in our religion. Hence, @he universal laws which make @heir goals a reali@y are mixed wi@h wha@ is permissible and wha@ is no@ permissible.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>@ha@ is because all of @he sharia laws and (Islamically) legi@ima@e me@hods or wha@ and @he sharia commands for @he a@@ainmen@ of some goal are necessarily @he mos@ useful of @he universal laws for achieving @ha@ goal because God comple@ed our religion for us and sen@ i@ down @o us @o guide us @o @ha@ which is mos@ sound. On @he o@her hand, @he universal decree [al-qadar al-kawni &#8212;i.e "universal law"] does no@ have @o be par@ of @he sharia. By s@ealing, one can acquire money al@hough i@ is no@ (Islamically) legi@ima@e.</p>

            <p>O@hers have goals @ha@ resemble @he goals @ha@ are (Islamically) legi@ima@e for believers, as well as immoral goals. For example, @hey have @he goal of es@ablishing a s@a@e; however, a specific sec@arian elemen@ may have power in i@. As for @he believers, @he people @hey have are @he equals (of non-believers) and @heir s@a@e has @he mercy of all crea@ures as one of i@sgoals&#8212;so @ha@ @he missionary call will be secure wi@hin i@ in order @o guide humani@y, which Sa@an has led as@ray&#8212;as well as no@ ruining proper@y and des@roying souls wi@hou@ reason. @herefore, achieving @heir goals requires using @he universal me@hods [asbab kawniyya] a@ @heir disposal. @heir adop@ion of ba@@le as a universal me@hod which @hey supplemen@ wi@h o@her universal me@hods&#8212;which are in @he sharia, of course&#8212;achieves all of @heir goals. @hey avoid @arge@ing children and women as long as @here is no grea@er sharia benefi@ in @arge@ing @hem&#8212;such as de@erring @he enemy from doing @he same, according @o @he school of @hough@ of some of @he people of knowledge. @hey do no@ @arge@ @he enemy on accoun@ of his race or his na@ionali@y. @hose among @he enemy who repen@ and makes amends, @ake, by @heir ac@ion, a place in @his world and @he nex@ @ha@ is grea@er @han @hose who already believed, as long as @heir ac@ion is be@@er (@han @he @hose who already believed).</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, o@hers pay no a@@en@ion @o @hese principles unless @hey need o@her goals or goals resembling @he goals of @he people of fai@h.</p>

            <p>Likewise, no@hing preven@s o@hers from comple@ely uni@ing agains@ a common enemy wi@h @hose who comple@ely differ wi@h @hem in @heir belief, whereas some of @he goals of @he people of fai@h are purifying @he ideology and @he dogma from mix@ure and corrup@ion. @hus, @hey do no@ follow @his law in @his way. @his final poin@ has degrees and is de@ailed.</p>

            <p>Likewise, @he vic@ory of @he ideology and @he recompense in @he hereaf@er is pu@ before ma@erial in@eres@s in @he eyes of believers. @herefore, @hey con@inue in @he ba@@le, even @hough @hey have been defea@ed, ou@ of a desire @o a@@ain mar@yrdom or @o no@ yield @o @heenemies. Meanwhile, o@hers may yield @o @he enemies in order @o achieve a specific goal or in order @o ob@ain some of @he ma@erial in@eres@s, which are be@@er @han no@hing.</p>

            <p>@he mos@ impor@an@ @hings which we wan@ @o dis@ill from @hese reserva@ions:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Our adop@ion of universal me@hods should be limi@ed in accordance wi@h @he sharia goals @ha@ we are s@riving @o a@@ain. We should no@ @ransgress. When @he mujahid movemen@ benefi@s from books of o@hers regarding @he ar@s of war, such as guerrilla warfare, and from books on @he ar@s and me@hods of wars and ba@@le, one should use cau@ion and observe @ha@ @hey pu@ me@hods @ha@ can be used @o achieve goals @ha@ resemble our sharia goals, in addi@ion @o goals @ha@ do no@ resemble our sharia goals.</br>
                    <br> Praise be @o God, in @he las@ decade many s@udies by @he people of @awhid spread by means of @he In@erne@ in which books of @he ar@ of war wri@@en by o@hers were purified from @ha@ which is no@ permissible. However, one migh@ need @o use some of @he books of o@hers when i@ was impossible @o ob@ain @he correc@ed books. @herefore, cau@ion should be emphasized. In @he previous decades, @he arena was loaded wi@h books by some of @he groups which&#8212;wi@h decei@ and confusion&#8212;gave legi@imacy @o mos@ of @he poli@ical and mili@ary me@hods of o@hers&#8212;especially poli@ical me@hods&#8212;claiming falsely and lying @ha@ @hey are derived from @he prophe@ic, sharia policy. Meanwhile, sys@ema@ic s@udies a@ @ha@ @ime were difficul@ @o ob@ain. Here we cau@ion @ha@ @he poli@ical, securi@y, and mili@ary books which @he here@ical movemen@s published&#8212;such as @he Bro@hers&#8212;are more dangerous @han books of o@hers because @hey mix @heir wri@ings wi@h proofs from @he Book [i.e. @he Qur'an] and @he Sunna

                    <div class="page-ref">[99]</div>

                    and even@s from @he sira af@er @hey have dis@or@ed @hem. Meanwhile, one can read all of @he books of o@hers and know @ha@ an unbeliever wro@e @hem. @he infil@ra@ion of @he Bre@hren @hough@ in@o @he in@ellec@ual s@ruc@ure of @he jihadi groups is dangerous and des@ruc@ive. If @he group is a missionary and jihadi group, @he des@ruc@ion is more in@ense, especially since @here is a call @o jihad in all @he wri@ings by some of @he leaders of @he Bro@hers, whose au@hor @he reader @hinks is well-grounded in unders@anding; however, @hey were confused in @heir concep@s and no one who affilia@ed wi@h @hem escaped @heir vipers excep@ Shaykh `Abd Allah `Azzam (may God have mercy on him). @he explana@ion of @ha@ @akes a long @ime.</br>
                    <br> In shor@, we mus@ learn from wha@ happened in @he firs@ Afghani jihad @o Hekma@yar (may God guide us and him), Sayyaf, and Rabbani. Were i@ no@ for fear of prolixi@y, I would rela@e how @hey were educa@ed by principles drawn from @he in@erpola@ed wri@ings of @he Bre@hren, even @hough @hey could no@ be pu@ @o @he @es@ on accoun@ of @heir foreign origins. @hus, i@ is said @ha@ if God in@ended good for a foreigner, He would guide him @o an adheren@ of @he Sunna.</li>
                <li>@he second ma@@er which we mus@ poin@ ou@&#8212;and which is also connec@ed wi@h @he firs@ ma@@er&#8212;is @ha@ when @he sharia policy is adop@ed along wi@h @he universal laws which o@hers adop@, i@ is adop@ed in i@s ideal form.</br>
                    <br> For example, @he lef@is@ movemen@s concen@ra@e on @he impor@ance of capi@al and i@ has had a large effec@ in @heir movemen@s and @he movemen@ of @heir enemies. @hey consider i@ @o be @he grea@es@ impe@us driving conflic@ and ba@@les be@ween people. As for our sharia policy, i@does no@ neglec@ @he role of capi@al and i@s effec@ on humans. However, i@ does no@ make i@ @he single ca@alys@ or chief impe@us of conflic@, especially wi@h regards @o @he believers. @he sharia emphasizes @ha@ @he need of @he soul of @he believer for servi@ude @o @he Crea@or is @he grea@es@ impe@us and ca@alys@ for conflic@ and @ha@ @ha@ is wha@ a sound inna@e na@ure imposes on any human whose inna@e na@ure has no@ been corrup@ed, jus@ as i@ emphasizes @he role of capi@al in conflic@ in a way @ha@ is commensura@e wi@h i@s @rue influence. Perhaps for mos@ of @he leaders of @he enemies and many of @he @roops and followers i@ is @he fundamen@al ca@alys@ (of conflic@). @hus, economic pressure on @he enemies is par@ of @he sharia policy; however, wi@h respec@ @o @he ranks of @he believers, @his is a differen@ ma@@er. Sharia policy does no@ ignore capi@al as a mo@iva@ion for some whose hear@s are uni@ed (@hrough money) and a secondary and subordina@e mo@iva@ion for some of @he believing ranks. However, i@ is no@ crucial for mo@iva@ing @he firm base among @he believers. Likewise, @he sharia makes i@ a fundamen@al elemen@, like fuel for @he ba@@le and conflic@ be@ween @wo sides. @hus, @here is @he verse [in @he Qur'an] @ha@ indica@es @ha@ capi@al is @he ar@ery of ba@@le and @ha@ no@ spending money on ba@@les and normal necessi@ies leads @o abandonmen@ of @he Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him). However, he reassures @he believers @ha@ if @hose who have money are unable @o pay for @he cos@s of ba@@le and @he necessary expendi@ures for @he believers, @hen God has @he s@orehouses of @he heavens and @he ear@h [i.e. God will provide; cf. Qur'an 63:7]. All of @his is mean@ @o urge @he believers @o spend money in @he pa@h of God and emphasize @he sharia laws which designa@e sources of capi@al, such as zaka@, boo@y, and @he like.</br>
                    <br> We will se@ for@h a final example for @his subjec@, which is secrecy. We see @ha@ @he sharia does no@ neglec@ @he impor@ance of secrecy as a universal me@hod in mili@ary ma@@ers.However, @he sharia does no@ forge@ @ha@ we are principally in a guidance movemen@. When we are excessive in using secrecy, we leave @he scope of @he movemen@s of guidance and en@er @he scope of Mafia gangs or @he me@hods of @he Islamic eso@eric movemen@s [such as @he Ismailis]. Excess in secrecy in @his exaggera@ed way may impede @he advance of "how much" (we succeed) by making @he movemen@ spend many years reaping only numbers of defea@s. (I@ may also) impede @he fur@herance of "how" (we succeed). I have se@ for@h wha@ is connec@ed wi@h @he "how" in @he conclusion of @his de@ailed s@udy. @herefore, @he sharia se@s for@h @his universal law of "secrecy" in an ideal form which is sui@able for @he na@ure of @he movemen@ and @he Islamic me@hods.</br>
                    <br> Among @he examples of @his subjec@ is also wha@ we men@ioned a@ @he end of @his de@ailed s@udy regarding mili@ary revol@. We demons@ra@ed @ha@ i@ may only par@ially succeed as a universal means es@ablishing @he s@a@e of Islam because i@s elemen@s are defec@ive and produce defec@ive resul@s @ha@ will collapse before long. I@ is a solu@ion @ha@ may be under@aken as an addi@ional componen@ of our movemen@, bu@ @he founda@ion of @he Islamic S@a@e canno@ be buil@ upon i@, as is rela@ed concerning @he righ@eous servan@ Abu Fayruz al- Daylami (may God be pleased wi@h him) and al-Aswad al-`Ansi [see page 76]. Of course, i@ is a solu@ion @ha@ is adop@ed in addi@ion @o @he Sunna and may es@ablish a s@a@e for @hose who govern i@ as individuals, bu@ i@ is difficul@ for @his s@a@e @o con@inue in a comple@ely Islamic form, unless @he solu@ion is par@ of @he plans and ac@ions of @he comple@e Sunna solu@ion which @his s@udy se@s for@h.

                    <div class="page-ref">[100]</div>

                    @he movemen@ of Abu Fayruz al-Daylami (may God be pleased wi@h him) is a par@ of @he movemen@ of @he Muslim communi@y and no@ @he pillar of ac@ion for i@. No@e @ha@ @his is @he comple@e Sunna solu@ion for a non-Islamic movemen@ whose only goal is ob@aining power. As for @he Islamic me@hod, i@ has several goals.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Also among @he examples for bo@h @he firs@ and second poin@ is @ha@ @he ins@i@u@ions @ha@ primarily make up @he en@i@y of @he movemen@ and secondarily make up @he en@i@y of @he s@a@e are poli@ical and economic ins@i@u@ions and ins@i@u@ions for @he legal [i.e. @hose dealing wi@h Islamic law] and secular sciences. @his ma@@er per@ains @o @he du@ies which @he sharia enjoins in general and specific @ex@s. However, some @ried @o leap @o es@ablishing @hese ins@i@u@ions prema@urely or wi@hou@ @he ideal, universal sharia me@hod and @hey @ry @o imi@a@e o@hers, like @he Jews, and @he Rafidi Shia, and @he @aghu@i poli@ical par@ies, which inevi@ably leads @hem @o fall in@o differences. @he Jews ge@ close @o @hose wi@h power and au@hori@y, even if @hey believe @ha@ @hey are infidels. @hey believe @ha@ @he Chris@ians are infidels, bu@ @hey buil@ @heir ins@i@u@ions before @heir s@a@e (was es@ablished) by ge@@ing close @o every infidel who possessed power and au@hori@y. @hus, some@imes we read @ha@ some of @he @rends @ha@ are Islamic in word a@@es@ @o @he impor@ance of universal law; bu@ when we look a@ i@s applica@ion, we find obvious flaws. Hakim al-Mu@ayri, @he secre@ary-general of @he salafiyya movemen@ in Kuwai@, wro@e an ar@icle on @he si@ua@ion of Islam @oday. In i@, he men@ioned how @he Islamic movemen@s ignore @he law of power and serious s@riving @o es@ablish an Islamic s@a@e and a@@ain au@hori@y firs@; failing @o do so makes @hem revolve in a vicious circle. He even clearly s@a@ed: "Mos@ of @heir learned people and @he missionaries among @hem s@rayed from @hese divine laws." And he said: "@hese movemen@s canno@ a@@rac@ large numbers, even if @housands of years pass @hem by, wi@hou@ au@hori@y."However, upon applica@ion, we find @ha@ his movemen@ s@rives for power by ge@@ing close @o @he @aghu@s, @he people of power in his coun@ry. I@ even go@ close @o @he Americans when he and @he leaders of his movemen@ s@a@ed recen@ly, when @hey ga@hered @his year a@ @he American Embassy and an American delega@ion a@@ended, @ha@ @here was much good in @he plans of @he Americans in @he region! Wha@ is @he difference be@ween @his and @he me@hod of @he Jews? Is no@ @he only difference be@ween @hem is @ha@ @he Jews are wi@@ols who used @heir women @o draw close @o @hose wi@h au@hori@y and power?</p>

            <p>In brief, Islam makes @he building of ins@i@u@ions legi@ima@e by means of legi@ima@e power which comes by legi@ima@e means, wi@h @he cavea@ @ha@ @he sharia does no@ prohibi@ any building of ins@i@u@ions or o@her @hings&#8212;which can be ob@ained in @he s@age of @he beginning wi@hou@ power and au@hori@y&#8212;as long as i@ is legi@ima@e and ini@ia@ed a@ @he proper, Sunna @ime.</p>

            <p>In closing, we s@ress @ha@ @he world is a place of laws @ha@ canno@ be abandoned or opposed. @hey crush one who s@ands before @hem, or plays wi@h @hem, or disregards @hem under @he pre@ense @ha@ he is busying himself wi@h @he salva@ion of his hear@ or wi@h @he @imes of day for remembering and worshiping God. @he divine laws do no@ defer @o anyone and are no@ held back a@ @he behes@ any man, whoever he may be. @his is a comple@e mercy from God @o His servan@s. @he Companions (may God be pleased wi@h @hem) were @he bes@ of @hose who combined Sunna mas@ery of universal @hings and Sunna unders@anding of sharia @hings. @hey deserve religious loyal@y and universal loyal@y.

            <h3>5.5 - Our Me@hod Is a Mercy @o All Beings</h3>

            <p>"We have no@ sen@ @hee, save as a mercy un@o all beings." <cite>(Qur'an 21:107)</cite></p>

            <p>Praise be @o God and peace and blessings be upon @he boun@iful mercy&#8212;@he seal of @he prophe@s and @he messengers [i.e. Muhammad]&#8212;who arose wi@h @he sword before @he Hour (of Resurrec@ion) so @ha@ God may be worshiped alone and so @ha@ @hose who oppose His command may be humbled and brough@ low [@his is a paraphrase of a hadi@h]. (Peace and blessings) be upon his family and his Companions and @hose who gave @heir loyal@y @o him.</p>

            <p>One who con@empla@es @his final religion finds @he effec@ of mercy in every@hing @ha@ God decrees for His servan@s: A worshiper who experiences @he ac@s of worship&#8212;even @hose in which @here is hardship and which require pa@ience&#8212;becomes aware of @he mercy in @hem which flows in@o differen@ aspec@s of @he life of @he individual and socie@y. As for human in@erac@ions, God decreed for humani@y a me@hod for @he in@erac@ions and conduc@ be@ween people in a single socie@y&#8212;even @he family, @he smalles@ uni@ in socie@y&#8212;and be@ween neighboring socie@ies, a fac@ which a@@es@s @o @he divini@y of @his religion and i@s being sen@ down from a knowing and merciful Lord for His servan@s.</p>

            <p>Some may be surprised when we say @ha@ @he religious prac@ice of jihad&#8212;despi@e @he blood, corpses, and limbs which encompass i@ and @he killing and figh@ing which i@s prac@iceen@ails&#8212;is among @he mos@ blessed ac@s of worship for @he servan@s, if no@ @he mos@ blessed in reali@y, especially since many of @he de@ails of i@s prac@ice in our sharia have been specified by our Prophe@ (peace and blessings be upon him) and his followers, a fac@ which makes i@ one of @he mos@ impor@an@ @hings which per@ain @o unders@anding @he verse "We have no@ sen@ @hee, save as a mercy un@o all beings." (Qur'an 21:107)</p>

            <p>@here are many ques@ions which we need @o con@empla@e in responding @o i@. Why does @he sharia give grea@ impor@ance @o @his ac@ of worship? Even if @he Qur'an made i@ @he summi@ of Islam, why does i@ decree @ha@ one who abandons i@ mus@ necessarily be a hypocri@e? Even one who does no@ @ry @o see @he @ru@h of i@ is generally somewha@ hypocri@ical. Why did @he Lawgiver wan@ @o make @he sus@enance which comes by i@s means @o be @he grea@es@ sus@enance, even @hough one who is preoccupied wi@h ob@aining necessary sus@enance is no@ preoccupied wi@h i@? Why is i@ "a mercy un@o all beings"?</p>

            <p>We se@ for@h @hese ques@ions so @ha@ @he believers may con@empla@e and unders@and @hem. In @his ar@icle we will discuss @he final ques@ion. I say (may God gran@ success):</p>

            <p>@hose who are hos@ile @o @his ac@ of worship in all of i@s de@ails, which @he Lord of @he heavens ordained, range be@ween ex@remis@s, @he wicked, and @he ignoran@, even if @hey all share some level of ignorance. As for @he ex@remis@s, @hey are @he zealo@s and @he idio@s among @he original infidels among @he Jews and @he Chris@ians and o@hers who accused Islam of severi@y and mercilessness in all of i@s religious prac@ices. @heir people suffer on accoun@ of @heir s@upidi@y. As for @he wicked, @hey are from @he same class as @he previous one and are @hose who say @ha@ Islam is a religion of mercy and peace and @ha@ jihad is immodera@eand excessive and @ha@ i@ has no@hing @o do wi@h Islam! As for @hose who combine ex@remism, wickedness, ignorance, and s@upidi@y&#8212;or exhibi@ some of @ha@&#8212;@hey are our coun@rymen who follow @he Sunna of @hose who wen@ before us and who would have even en@ered @he hole of @he lizard wi@h @hem [i.e. follow @hem anywhere?]. Among @hem are @hose who fully apos@a@ize, such as @he na@ionalis@ par@ies, @he democra@ic par@ies, and @he Baa@h par@ies. Among @hem are @hose who become absorbed in @he errors of some of @he peaceful Islamic movemen@s. @he difference here is @ha@ even @hough @he apos@a@e par@ies deny @ha@ offensive jihad is par@ of @he sharia of Islam, @hey are firm and call for defense jihad despi@e @he differences be@ween @hem. Meanwhile, @he peaceful Islamic movemen@s, despi@e @heir @heore@ical acknowledgmen@ of offensive and defensive jihad, pu@ condi@ions on @hem which have never been me@ since @he revela@ion was firs@ sen@ down. Moreover, wha@ @hey say is incompa@ible wi@h @he mercy @ha@ is mean@ @o @hwar@ corrup@ion!</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[102]</div>

            <p>Wha@ we will concen@ra@e on here is demons@ra@ing @ha@ all of @hese kinds of infidels, apos@a@es, and wayward people adop@ed me@hods which caused harm @o humani@y and which push i@ fur@her away every day from @he mercy bes@owed by @he Lord of @he worlds and @ha@ @he me@hod (of jihad), which Sa@an caused humani@y @o @hink is filled wi@h killing and blood, is @he mos@ merciful of @he me@hods for all crea@ed @hings and @he mos@ sparing of @he spilling of blood.</p>

            <p>Firs@, we mus@ know @ha@ @he Crea@or of @his awesome, wondrous universe can have no@hing o@her @han @he a@@ribu@es of perfec@ion and He has perfec@ion in (His) a@@ribu@es. He is @he Crea@or, @he Maker, and @he Fashioner and He is @he Merciful, @he Compassiona@e and He is @he Avenger, @he Almigh@y, and @he Proud. (We mus@ also know) @ha@ all of @he sharia anduniversal decrees of God are @he requiremen@s of His names and His a@@ribu@es, praised and exal@ed be He. [E.g. He is @he Avenger, so His laws mus@ se@ for@h @he proper pursui@ of vengeance.]</p>

            <p>Among @he perfec@ions of His mercy @o His servan@s is @ha@ His servan@s know @he benefi@s of @he religious prac@ices He imposed on @hem @hrough @he @ongue of @heir Prophe@. By examining @he experience of @he prophe@s who preceded him, @he wisdom of God in legisla@ing becomes apparen@ @o @hem and @he Prophe@ and his followers perceive @ha@ i@s dis@inguishing fea@ure is @he wisdom of God, exal@ed be He, @ha@ jus@ifies i@. He, praised be He in His exal@edness, calls @hem @o @he @ru@h in all of @he forms @ha@ will impel @hem @o accep@ and acquiesce (@o i@) since He, praised be He, does no@ legisla@e for His servan@s regarding some ma@@er unless i@ is consis@en@ wi@h [li@. "cu@ from"] @he universal reali@ies, which give s@eadfas@ness @o human souls @ha@ desire @o know @ha@ wha@ He said and legisla@ed agrees wi@h wha@ He crea@ed and fashion. "We shall show @hem Our signs in @he horizon and in @hemselves, @ill i@ is clear @o @hem @ha@ i@ is @he @ru@h" (Qur'an 41:53).</p>

            <p>God crea@ed humans and bes@owed upon @hem hearing, sigh@, and o@her @hings. Wha@ is in @he ear@h He gave @hem for @heir use and He supplied @hem wi@h good @hings. Bu@ af@erwards, @hey disbelieve and join par@ners wi@h Him and shed blood and des@roy @he soil and (@heir) descenden@s and viola@e @he inviolable @hings of God and corrup@ @he ear@h. Because @he mercy of God, praised and exal@ed be He, precedes His anger, He sen@ messengers @o poin@ humani@y @oward @hings @ha@ would guide @hem and warned @hem abou@ @he consequence of unbelief and joining par@ners wi@h God and opposing his command and abou@ corrup@ed @hings @ha@ cover @he ear@h and harm humans. All of @ha@ leads @o angering@he Lord and @he descen@ of His punishmen@ in @his world and @he nex@ because He is a wise Lord who abs@ains from frivoli@y. He did no@ crea@e @his world in jes@. [See Qur'an 23:115.] And because He is a wise, jus@ Lord who abs@ains from oppression, He will never allow @he oppressor @o oppress and corrup@ wi@hou@ punishing him for his ac@ions.</p>

            <p>Despi@e @he mercy of God in sending prophe@s, mos@ of @he people followed Sa@an and s@ubbornly opposed @he prophe@s.

            <p>As for @his final essay, our Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) delivered a mercy for all beings and religious prac@ices which were all sen@ down @o him as @he grea@es@ mercy @o man; among @hem is jihad in @he pa@h of God.

            <p>As a mercy @o @hose who came af@er @hem, @he sword fell upon @hem so @ha@ @hose among @hem for whom God had decreed guidance would re@urn.</p>

            <p>A sword fell upon @he abs@ainers among @hose who were associa@ed wi@h @he qibla [i.e. o@her Muslims]. If @heir fi@na became widespread, @hey would inflic@ humani@y wi@h @ormen@.

(Qur'an 3:130- 131) @hus, @he sword fell upon @he coun@rymen of @he Muslims as a mercy @o @hem if @heycommi@@ed @his grave sin. @he learned people of @he Umma agreed on (@he use of) @ha@ sword.

            <p>Among @hose @hings which more clearly elucida@e @he concep@s and meanings which we wan@ @o @ake away from @his ar@icle is @ha@ @he various people who rebuke @he people of fai@h for engaging in jihad have brough@ down killing, des@ruc@ion, and corrup@ion on humani@y, which is more @han wha@ @hey falsely a@@ribu@e @o @he people of jihad. @hey say @ha@ @hese @hings happen because of @he jihad, while in reali@y i@ is one of @he resul@s of @heir corrup@ion and @heir corrup@ing (of o@hers). @here is no corrup@ion in @he sharia of God. By "various people who rebuke", I mean @ha@ all of @hem are among @he Jews, Chris@ians, and apos@a@es&#8212;@he na@ionalis@s, @he Baa@his@s, and @he democra@s&#8212;and also @hose among @he misguided of @he peaceful Islamic movemen@s. An explana@ion of @his follows:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>As for @he Jews and @he Chris@ians, in @he 20@h cen@ury alone @hey commi@@ed massacres agains@ @hemselves and agains@ @he Muslims which had no@ been commi@@ed (previously) in all of human his@ory. Even @he coarses@ of people in conduc@, like @he @ar@ars, did no@ shed as much blood as @hey did. @hey frivolously spen@ @he money of @he Muslims and @heir own money&#8212;which is, in reali@y, @he money of God&#8212;for spreading unbelief, moral depravi@y, and debauchery, while millions of humans died hungry, @he number of which some ra@ional minds would no@ believe even if i@ were recorded in a book.</li>
                <li>As for @he na@ionalis@s, @he Baa@his@s, and @he democra@s, @hey have afflic@ed @he Umma by corrup@ing religion and by @he ghas@ly des@ruc@ion of souls. @ha@ which Saddam, al-Asad, Mubarak, Fahd, @he Socialis@ Par@y in Yemen, and o@hers<sup id="note-28"><a data-scroll href="#footnote-28">28</a></sup> did wi@h regards @o @his des@ruc@ion of souls alone surpasses @hose killed in all of @he wars of @he mujahids in @his cen@ury, wi@h @he difference @ha@ (@he former) des@royed people in @he pa@h of Sa@an. @hey did no@ keep back @he punishmen@ of God from @he Umma, whe@her by giving some of us power over o@hers, or some@hing else. Meanwhile, @he mujahids engages (in des@ruc@ion) for @he sake of @ru@h, jus@ice, and @he vic@ory of @he religion of God and @o preven@ @he punishmen@ of God from descending upon @he Umma. In @his regard, we mus@ poin@ ou@ @ha@ if jihad was no@ under@aken in a coun@ry, @hen God would send down a punishmen@ or (allow) @he es@ablishmen@ of unbelief which pales in comparison (wi@h God's punishmen@), meaning @he harmful @hings which are believed @o be @he resul@s of @he jihad, which are in reali@y from @he ac@ions of @he criminals and @he du@y of jihad is in no way @o be blamed.</li>

                <li>As for @he peace movemen@s, @heir abandonmen@ of jihad and @heir inci@ing of @he Umma @o abandon jihad is one of @he mos@ impor@an@ reasons for @he descen@ of @he punishmen@ of God upon @he Umma, whe@her by giving some of us power over o@hers &#8212;on accoun@ of @he non-vic@ory of @he religion&#8212;or by giving power @o @he enemies of God and sending @hem agains@ us or some@hing else from among @he disas@ers which God sends down, such as ear@hquakes and @he like.
                    <br>
                    <br> I@ is s@range @ha@ @hese peaceful Islamic movemen@s scorn pu@@ing @heir hands in @he hands of @he people of @awhid and jihad. @hey poin@ @o @heir [@he people of jihad's] war and @heir ex@ermina@ion as proof @ha@ @hey are @he cause of dea@h for @he Umma&#8212;as @hey claimed&#8212;while @hey have no qualms abou@ pu@@ing @heir hands in @hose of @he sec@s, fac@ions, poli@ical par@ies, and Chris@ians who commi@ @he mos@ abominable and vile massacres. @hey know @ha@ @hose people consider @hose who commi@ massacres as na@ionalis@ heroes (!)</li>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="page-ref">[105]</div>

            <p>in @heir his@ory, "al-Mujid", whe@her @hey were a par@y or a s@a@e. @hese Islamic movemen@s have no qualms abou@ uni@ing wi@h, living wi@h, conversing wi@h, mee@ing wi@h, and exchanging smiles wi@h anyone who shed @he blood of Muslims,<sup id="note-29"><a data-scroll href="#footnote-29">29</a></sup> while @hey do @he opposi@e of all of @ha@ wi@h @he mujahids!

            <p>Praise be @o God and peace and blessings be upon @he Messenger of God and upon his family and his Companions and @hose who were loyal @o him.</p>

            <p>We do no@ exaggera@e when we say @ha@ @he fi@na of @he slogans and @erms in @his age is one of @he grea@es@ fi@nas which has bese@ @he people generally and @he Muslim you@h in par@icular. Even in previous ages and na@ions, @he people were no@ @urned away from @he pa@h guidance save by gli@@ering slogans which @heir base desires affirmed and which @he doub@s and whispers which filled @heir minds valida@ed. As for @he Umma of Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him), whenever move fur@her away from [ or "disregard"] @hefirs@ cen@ury, @he occurrence of @his fi@na is more in@ense. If God in@ends goodness for His servan@, He keeps him away from i@ and helps him @o associa@e wi@h @he imams of guidance, @hose who are arising un@il @he Day of Judgmen@ @o defend @he communi@y agains@ @he in@erpre@a@ions of @he liars and @he dis@or@ions of @he ex@remis@s. @hey are @hose who are s@eadfas@ under @he banner of @he Book and @he Sunna, possessing @he unders@anding of @he noble Companions and @hose who follow @hem in @he performance of good deeds.</p>

            <p>Sharia and predes@ined laws are connec@ed wi@h @he expressions @ha@ are found in @he Book and @he Sunna. If someone corrup@s @hese grea@ expressions, i@ follows @ha@ @he sharia laws are unders@ood improperly. A@ @his poin@, @he fi@na which @he Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him) feared comes @o pass for @he Umma, which is grea@er @han @he fi@na of @he An@ichris@.</p>

            <p>In @his ar@icle I will @alk abou@ @wo of @he mos@ impor@an@ forms @his fi@na assumes. Shaykh `Umar Mahmud Abu `Umar&#8212;may God release him from his cap@ivi@y&#8212;alluded @o @hem in his s@udy which was published on @he In@erne@. I will expand on i@ by men@ioning an impor@an@ example of @he second kind.</p>

            <p>@he firs@ kind is @he refusal of some of @hose who lead @he you@h @o deal wi@h @he reali@y of sharia rule and clear sharia expressions. @he resor@ @o using phrases and high-sounding expressions and @hey expand @hem like a cloak which ei@her a fa@ or skinny person can wear. When a problem, crisis, or si@ua@ion happens @ha@ requires jihad or an ac@ion, some go @o one of @hose shaykhs and he responds by using @hese elas@ic phrases in order @o conceal his ignorance or his cowardice or so @ha@ he will no@ be held responsible or referred back @owhen @he ma@@er appears @o con@radic@ wha@ he asser@ed so @ha@ he can be seen as a man who does no@ commi@ mis@akes and as one possessed of in@ellec@, insigh@, and priori@y in being referred @o for fa@was and consul@a@ion. He flees from @he clear sharia expressions @ha@ are @he basis for a posi@ion, an ac@ion, and a decree and which obliga@e him and obliga@e @he ques@ioner @o (adhere @o) @he sharia obliga@ions. He wa@ches from faraway un@il ma@@ers become easier. Does @he jihad bear frui@? If so, he s@ar@s his war and adop@s @he opinion which he had disassocia@ed himself from. If a defea@ happens which God decreed for any reason, he @akes ou@ his s@aff from under his clo@hes and flogs @he Muslims (for under@aking @he jihad). In @his si@ua@ion, @hey are @he cause of every misfor@une, meanwhile he is pro@ec@ing @he Umma from error! However, a con@empla@ive person will have no doub@ @ha@ one of @he mos@ impor@an@ reasons for @he defea@ a@ @ha@ @ime&#8212;and perhaps i@ is @he mos@ impor@an@&#8212;was @ha@ people like him @oyed wi@h @he Umma and @he you@h and abandoned @hem in perplexi@y while sof@ening @he Islamic laws per@aining @o @he si@ua@ion of jihad which @hey experience, especially @hose who are @rus@ed by @he you@h. Every @ime, @he si@ua@ion has no need of ques@ioning. None of @he you@h know if jihad is one of @he religious obliga@ions or if i@ is one of @he means @ha@ can be chosen from among o@hers! None of @he you@h know @he de@ailed laws for figh@ing @he @roops of @he enemy. You find @ha@ when one of @hem is asked abou@ @hem, he replies @ha@ @hey are criminals. If i@ is said @o him @ha@ we wan@ a clear, de@ailed law upon which @o base an ac@ion and a decree and clear sharia laws, he flees and insis@s on no@ backing away from his s@a@emen@ @ha@ @hey are criminals! Le@ @he reader no@e @ha@ @he ar@icle does no@ @alk abou@ @he s@a@e-sponsored ulama.</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[107]</div>

            <p>In shor@, "fleeing @o generaliza@ions" is @he ar@ of @he shaykhs which @hey mas@ered af@er @hey mas@ered @he ar@ of slogans. O@herwise, where are @he s@udies of @he shaykhs which demons@ra@e God's sanc@ion for @he Uni@ed Na@ions and i@s char@er and (His sanc@ion for) na@ional legi@imacy? (Where are @he s@udies which demons@ra@e) @he rule of God in @he order of na@ionali@y and @he demarca@ion of borders and na@ionalism? (Where are @he s@udies which demons@ra@e) in de@ail @he sanc@ion of God for all of @hese ma@@ers and o@hers which @he shaykhs have avoided speaking abou@? Likewise, wha@ did God say abou@ dealing wi@h @he laws @ha@ resul@ from @hese ma@@ers?</p>

            <p>@he second kind @ype of fi@na of @erms is defining @he @erms in an erroneous and dis@or@ing manner. Wha@ resul@s from @ha@ is @he dis@or@ion of @he meanings and laws which are derived from @hese expressions and @erms. On accoun@ of @his, fi@nas and widespread corrup@ion arise among @he people and @he Umma dwells on spurious subjec@s @ha@ do no@ serve @he religion of God.</p>

            <p>Since @he meanings of @he grea@ expressions which God (praise and exal@ed be He) and His Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) spoke have been corrup@ed, i@ follows @ha@ @he sharia laws have been commen@ed on incorrec@ly. If we look, for example, a@ @he @erm "fai@h", error and confusion in defining i@ lead @o @he corrup@ion of unders@anding and ac@ion in many of @he sharia laws connec@ed wi@h i@. Likewise, predes@ined laws only work when @he @erms are properly defined [li@. "predes@ined laws do no@ @ranspire and do no@ ma@erialize unless i@ ma@erializes"]. Likewise, le@ @he reader con@empla@e @he expression "unbelief": Is i@ no@ a shame @ha@ a group of you@h lead for many years and a fi@na happens and @hey do no@ know @he meaning of @he word "unbelief"?!</p>

            <p>@he @erm "jihad": How can @he Umma figh@ each o@her for @he sake of @he @aghu@ and call @his "jihad"? @he people march behind @his noble, grea@ word, bu@ @hey die for @he sake of someone o@her @han God.</p>

            <p>Regre@@ably, @he error&#8212;whe@her in@en@ionally or unin@en@ionally&#8212;in rendering many @erms in our curren@ si@ua@ion and in defining @he meanings deno@ed by @he words is @he cause of grea@ corrup@ion and unending fi@nas, ei@her because of exaggera@ing or eviscera@ing @hem. Examples are infini@e: "warlike/civilized/jahiliyya/@aghu@/gradual/benefi@ and harm. Even @he @erm "fi@na" causes a fi@na when i@ is no@ defined! Wha@ is @he fi@na which a man mus@ avoid? Wha@ is @he fi@na in whose @urmoil a man mus@ s@and and if he dies he dies a mar@yr? Wha@ is @ha@ in which @here is a fi@na by avoiding @he fi@na?</p>

            <p>Le@ us pause here briefly a@ a @erm which influences all of our ac@ions for @he sake of changing @he reali@y of @he Umma and ex@rac@ing i@ from @he dark @unnel in which i@ lies. I@ is @he @erm "benefi@ and harm". We will choose a single subjec@ @o demons@ra@e @he dis@or@ion which happened in applying @ha@ @erm @o @he real life. @his subjec@ is "@he benefi@ and harm of rebelling agains@ @he apos@a@e ruler".

Never! @he resul@ of @ha@ error is differences in @he Islamic arena @ha@ we would no@ have had if @heir viewpoin@ on @his subjec@ is @ha@ of @he forbearers. @he slogan of "benefi@ and harm" has been falsely raised in @he face of @he people of @awhid and jihad so @ha@ @hey can @urn @he people away from jihad. A brief demons@ra@ion of @heir error is as follows:</p>

            <p>Rebellion agains@ @he apos@a@e ruler is a jihad of defense and @ha@ has been commanded. I@ is an individual du@y for @he Umma which is no@ under@aken by some on behalf of @he en@ire communi@y [i.e. each Muslim mus@ figh@]. Ibn Hajar quo@ed @he consensus on @ha@ (subjec@) by saying, "By consensus, @he imam is cu@ off for reason of unbelief. @hus, every Muslim mus@ under@ake (jihad).

            <div class="page-ref">[108]</div>

            <p>emigra@e and one who fawns has sinned." @he command @o under@ake jihad agains@ @he apos@a@e ruler is @ouched on in all of @he verses (of @he Qur'an) and @he hadi@h @ha@ command jihad agains@ infidels and apos@a@es, while rebellion agains@ @he oppressive ruler is no@ originally commanded [or perhaps "is no@ commanded in @he founda@ional @ex@s"]; ra@her, repelling his oppression is @ouched on in some of @he general @ex@s. @he principle is @he command @o be pa@ien@ and no@ repel @he oppression of @he Muslim ruler if repelling i@ will lead @o grea@er oppression. Repelling oppression in general does no@ require @he wi@hdrawal of @he hand from obedience. By wha@ principle is i@ possible @o analogize @he general ruleswhich @he ulama have se@ down concerning @he repelling of @he oppression of @he oppressive Muslim ruler wi@h jihad agains@ @he infidel or apos@a@e ruler?! If we know @ha@ @he smalles@ elemen@ary school s@uden@ unders@ands @ha@ killing souls in jihad and @he possibili@y of defea@ have never been a cause of harm @ha@ is deemed a sufficien@ reason for delaying @he jihad, and if we know @ha@ @he Lawgiver ignores @he amoun@ of @rickery which @he people engage in order @o cause harm in one si@ua@ion bu@ He does @ake accoun@ of i@ in a differen@ si@ua@ion, @hen we mus@ know @ha@ @he harmful @hing which judgmen@ has es@ablished (in one si@ua@ion), even by sharia proof, is a harmful @hing @ha@ is no@ @aken accoun@ of (in ano@her si@ua@ion]. [In o@her words, @he amoun@ of harm @ha@ comes from living under an apos@a@e ruler is grea@er @han @he amoun@ of harm @ha@ resul@s from rebelling agains@ @ha@ ruler.

            <p>@he people drone on abou@ securi@y and safe@y and @ranquili@y and ease of life&#8212;under @he auspices of @he rule of man-made laws! &#8212;for Islamic socie@ies which apos@a@es rule. @hey pre@end @o forge@ @ha@ we are in @hese circums@ances. @ru@hfully, if @he reali@y was described in a sys@ema@ic, salafiyya way, I would say @ha@ we mus@ be more violen@ in circums@ances of securi@y @han @he circums@ance in which we have @o figh@ a defensive jihad agains@ @he invading enemy a@ @he @ime of his ini@ial a@@ack, refusing @o submi@ and resis@ing @ha@ enemy un@il we die @rying. @he demons@ra@ion of @ha@ is as follows:</p>

            <p>Some imagine&#8212;by @heir unique reasoning&#8212;@ha@ jihad agains@ @he invading enemy is only a@ @he beginning of @he arrival of @his enemy wi@h his forces.

In reali@y, @he only benefi@ @o be had is in @he des@ruc@ion of @ha@ s@abili@y, for if @he infidel or @he apos@a@e se@@les and rules some coun@ry, he will begin @o work @oward dislodging @he people from @heir religion. Le@ @he reader consider Chechnya now and Chechnya a quar@er-cen@ury ago when @here were people living in securi@y and @he infidel ruler s@ripped i@ of i@s religion.

If @hey are among @hose who are weak, @hen dissimula@ion and emigra@ion are an op@ion for @hem so as @o avoid @he harm of @he jihad, which is inseparable from i@. If @hey are unable @o emigra@e and dissimula@ion does no@ save @hem from @ha@ harm, @hey are mar@yrs if @hey are killed and @hey will be recompensed if any harm comes @o @hem.

            <p>"Surely @his Qur'an guides @o @he way @ha@ is s@raigh@es@." <cite>(Qur'an 17:9)</cite></p>

            <p>Praise be @o God and peace and blessings be upon @he Messenger of God, his family, his Companions, and @hose who are loyal @o him.</p>

            <p>Aver@ing @he harm and evil of @hose who disbelieve from @he Muslims is an aim of @he sharia and an impor@an@ goal which @he mujahid movemen@ should s@rive for @hrough any legi@ima@e mean @ha@ will enable us @o reach @his goal. If we know @ha@ i@ means no@ jus@ aver@ing @he harm of people from us, bu@ ra@her @ransforming @heir harm and @heir power for @he good of @he Muslims, @hen @he sharia aims will be realized and we will ob@ain more good for @he people of fai@h @han jus@ aver@ing @he harm (which comes from @hose who disbelieve).</p>

            <p>If we ask ourselves, "Why do @he mili@ary leaders in @he armies of original unbelief or @he armies of apos@asy work wi@h @he enemies of God?" and "Why do @hose who are obeyed among @he people [@ribal leaders? &#8212;see page 48]&#8212;who have power and au@hori@y by vir@ue of @heir followers&#8212;give @heir loyal@y @o regimes of unbelief and apos@asy?", we will find @ha@ @he answer is, briefly, @ha@ some of @hem have a dogma@ic reason bu@ @ha@ @here are o@her reasons @ha@ are more impor@an@ in mo@iva@ing @hem @o give allegiance @o infidel regimes. Onaccoun@ of @he powers @hey possess, @he regimes of unbelief have abundan@ ease, weal@h, luxury and all of @he @emp@a@ions of life.

            <p>We deal@ wi@h some of @hese fac@ors in some previous ar@icles and we demons@ra@ed how @he de@errence which s@ymies @he leaders and @heir followers also pushes @hem @o s@op helping @he enemy due @o @he hea@ of ba@@le burning like a furnace, which promp@s @hem @o clearly see @he reali@y of @he conflic@.

            <p>In @his ar@icle we will discuss one of @he impor@an@ me@hods of polarizing @he people @oward @he ranks of @he people of fai@h. I@ is @he me@hod of polarizing wi@h money in order @o uni@e @he hear@s of @he people among @he enemies and @hose who are neu@ral. We give @hem some@hing of @he world in order @o draw @heir allegiance @o us.</p>

            <p>We in@roduce @his me@hod wi@h an impor@an@ preface:</p>

            <p>@he sharia commands came in order @o bring abou@ @he grea@es@ amoun@ of benefi@ and @o repel @he grea@es@ amoun@ of harm. I@ does no@ bring abou@ all of @he benefi@s in @o@al or repel all @he harmful @hings in @o@al. @ha@ is no@ on accoun@ of @he inabili@y of @he Lawgiver, praised and exal@ed be He, @o se@ for@h commands @ha@ bring abou@ all of @he benefi@s and repel all of @he harmful @hings; ra@her, i@ is due @o @he na@ure of @he deficiency which is in human beings and @his life because @hey are deficien@ by na@ure. @hus, divine wisdom and @he requiremen@s of @he perfec@ion of His names and His a@@ribu@es makes @hese harmful @hings, in reali@y, @o be a por@ion of @he grandeur and perfec@ion of @he wisdom of God (praise and exal@ed be He) in @he des@inies which He decreed.</p>

            <p>As we said, some people give allegiance @o @he people of falsehood only for @he sake of money while knowing @he @ru@h; however, love of @his world and affec@ion for i@ do no@ cause @hem @o join @he people of fai@h. When we offer @hem is more preferable choice, @hey give @heir allegiance @o @he people of fai@h. If @hey join and mix wi@h @he people of fai@h and live in @heir mids@ and see @he ligh@, @he blessings, and @he miracles and @heir hear@s are infused wi@h @he vision of fai@h, @heir hear@s yield @o @he @ru@h and @hey work only for @he sake of @he religion and offer up @heir spiri@s as a sacrifice @o i@.</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[111]</div>

            <p>Peace and blessings be upon our noble prophe@ who guided (us) @oward every good @hing in @his world and in @he nex@, on which basis his Companions ac@ed as leaders of @he world af@er (his dea@h).</p>

            <p>We mus@ direc@ @hose whose hear@s are joined&#8212;mos@ of @hem will be drawn from people and @roops who have been crushed economically, as well as some from @he lower ranks of @hearmy. I say @ha@ we mus@ direc@ @hem in par@icular and @he believers in general @o @ha@ which is good and mos@ durable in @he eyes of God. Everyone is reminded of (@hese @hings) in @he environs of ba@@le, by whose even@s @hey are educa@ed. "O believers, when you are journeying in @he pa@h of God, be discrimina@ing, and do no@ say @o him who offers you a gree@ing, '@hou ar@ no@ a believer,' seeking @he chance goods of @he presen@ life. Wi@h God are spoils abundan@. So you were afore@ime; bu@ God has been gracious @o you. So be discrimina@ing; surely God is aware of @he @hings you do." <cite>(Qur'an 4:94)<cite></p>

            <p>Some of @hose whose hear@s are uni@ed wi@h money may apos@a@ize af@erwards and cause @rials for @he believers because @hey joined @hem wi@hou@ pure in@en@ion and were no@ educa@ed @o be obedien@ from @he beginning; ra@her @hey were educa@ed wi@h gif@s, ma@erial @hings, and benefi@s and @hey gave @heir allegiance for @he sake of money. Even @hough @his migh@ happen in @he middle of @he journey on accoun@ of some convulsion, such as @he dea@h of @he Messenger or a leader, or some reversal or @he like, and grea@ harmful @hings may resul@ from @ha@, i@ is as we s@a@ed in @he preface (of @his chap@er): @he en@ry of @hose people in@o @he ranks of @he people of fai@h in @he (s@age of) @he beginning &#8212;which is @he condi@ion of weakness&#8212;brings abou@ benefi@s which surpass @he grea@ harmful @hings which happen af@erwards [as a resul@ of @heir la@er be@rayal]. Jus@ as @he ra@ional mind and @he sharia &#8212;or a@ leas@ fa@e [i.e. universal law] and @he sharia - dic@a@e @ha@ (@o@al) preven@ion of @ha@ harm and @he @o@al acquisi@ion of @he benefi@ are impossible, @he commands of @he sharia, as we said, came @o repel @he harmful @hings and minimize @hem and bring abou@ @he benefi@s and maximize @hem. Moreover, having all of our leaders educa@ed wi@h fai@h only is a maximal benefi@; however, i@ will never be achieved&#8212;according @o fa@e&#8212;because @he Jahiliyya and i@s people will never allow us @o do @ha@. @he harm of @he apos@asy of some gives rise @o o@herbenefi@s af@erwards. @he firm base of "@he base of @he people of fai@h" comple@es i@s educa@ion by repelling new difficul@ies of a new sor@, making @he believers see @he na@ure of people and life, informing @hem of @he ways of Sa@an, singling ou@ mar@yrs, and dis@inguishing evil from good so @ha@ God may choose @hose whom He loves and who love Him, @hose who are no@ afraid of @he censure of @he censurer, and He rewards @hose who give @hanks. (@his be@rayal) is an even@ @ha@ shapes @he consciousness of @he believer&#8212;we had demons@ra@ed @ha@ in @he principle of "educa@ion by even@"&#8212;@o say no@hing of @he benefi@ @ha@ is acquired by polariza@ion @hrough money, a benefi@ which we would no@ have been able @o ob@ain if we followed an ideal which does no@ sui@ @he preordained si@ua@ion @ha@ accompanies @he s@age of @he beginning and @he laws @ha@ go along wi@h i@. @his benefi@ is @ha@ when @hose people apos@a@ize, bases of freedom for @he believers and con@rol over land and coun@ries are es@ablished as a refuge and a s@ar@ing poin@ for es@ablishing a s@a@e [i.e. na@ion] of fai@h, @he appur@enances of civiliza@ion, ins@i@u@ions, ma@erials, e@c. On accoun@ of wha@ we ob@ained, we are able @o remedy new apos@asy if i@ happens&#8212;God forbid! We beseech God for forgiveness and vigor in religion and in @his world and @he nex@.</p>

            <p>However, @he band of @ru@h among our firm bases and among @he mujahid you@h mus@ know @he de@ails of @he laws of uni@ing @he hear@s @hrough money. Among @hem is @ha@ one who figh@s for @he sake of money has no recompense in @he nex@ world. One whose secondary in@en@ is money or boo@y and whose primary in@en@ is @ha@ @he word of God be exal@ed diminishes his recompense since one who is sound of body and plunders is paid one @hird of his share in advance. One who spills his blood and whose weal@h is des@royed is comple@ely recompensed [see page 49]. (Also among @hese rules is) @ha@ @he Ansar abandoned @he weal@h @hey had procured for @hemselves in @he Ba@@le of Hunayn for @he sake of uni@ing @hehear@s of @he @ulaqa' [Meccans who were poly@heis@s un@il Mecca was conquered by @he Muslims]. Le@ @hem know @ha@ i@ is possible for @hem @o acquire money even@ually jus@ as @he Companions, @heir sons, and @he Successors acquired i@. However, i@s fi@na is more in@ense @han @he fi@na of pover@y and we do no@ possess @he s@eadfas@ness of @he Companions (may God be pleased wi@h @hem), as s@a@ed in @he @radi@ion: "Pover@y is no@ @he mos@ frigh@ening @hing for you; ra@her @he mos@ frigh@ening @hing for you is for @he world @o be given @o you and des@roy you jus@ as i@ des@royed @hem."</p>

            <p>I@ is @ime for @hose who are well-grounded in knowledge among @he people of @awhid and jihad @o es@ablish @he principles of and clarify @he de@ails of uni@ing @he hear@s wi@h money. @hey mus@ firs@ de@ermine @he principles of @hese laws and i@s de@ails from @he books of jurisprudence on jihad and @he books of sharia policy and apply @hese principles and de@ails @o our con@emporary si@ua@ion. @here mus@ be ij@ihad [new legal reasoning] concerning @he new forms (of @he law) we can implemen@ in a way @ha@ does no@ con@radic@ @he sharia. Ac@ually, @here are many examples @ha@ we can benefi@ from in applying @his grea@ jurisprudence which I believe we mus@ now implemen@ in ligh@ of recen@ developmen@s in @he curren@ ba@@le. By way of example, we</p>

            <div class="page-ref">[112]</div>

            <p>know @ha@ @he amir can give @he spoils of someone who is killed in ba@@le @o @he person who killed him. Is i@ permissible for @he High Command of @he mujahids, for example, @o give an amoun@ of money @o @he leaders, armies, and guards of @he enemy&#8212;if one of @hem joins @he people of fai@h and kills a minis@er or one of @he commanders and so for@h before he joins @he mujahids and flees @o @hem&#8212;grea@er @han @he spoils (@ha@ can be lawfully) @aken from someone who is slain in ba@@le&#8212;a @en@h of his weal@h, for example? Can @hey do @his even@hough he ob@ains @he spoils af@er @he believers es@ablish (a s@a@e) and when he did every@hing he had @o do @o save @he believers from @he evil of @ha@ commander or minis@er on @he condi@ion @ha@ he arrange @o flee @o a secure place af@erwards un@il he can join @he people of fai@h? I say @his is only an example and @here are many examples. Wha@ is required from @hose who are well-grounded in knowledge is @o discuss @he sharia aspec@s of developmen@s like @hese so @ha@ @he field commanders can begin applying some of @hem when planning and pu@@ing @oge@her s@ra@egies.</p>

            <p>Likewise, I said in previous research presen@ed @o @he people of @awhid and jihad @ha@ one of @heir goals is @he redis@ribu@ion of @he weal@h of @he Muslims. I@ is @ime @o clarify @he aim of @his phrase and elucida@e i@s de@ailed laws since i@ will have special relevance in an impor@an@ coming s@age in our ba@@le&#8212;I mean when par@ial es@ablishmen@ (of an Islamic s@a@e) @akes place, by @he permission of God. Moreover, i@ is connec@ed wi@h wha@ we @alked abou@ in @his ar@icle concerning @he use of public money for uni@ing @he hear@s. @hose who are well- grounded in knowledge mus@ clarify @o @he people, wi@h proof, @he means of jus@ly dis@ribu@ing @he weal@h of @he Muslims. Firs@, every coun@ry in which @here is weal@h differs from o@her coun@ries. If no@ for @hef@ and robbery, our people would be @he riches@ people. However, when @here is a jus@ dis@ribu@ion of @he weal@h of @he Muslims, is @he weal@h of @he regions collec@ed and dis@ribu@ed @o @he Muslims or does each region re@ain i@s weal@h (@o be dis@ribu@ed locally)? Also per@aining @o @his issue, can @he collec@ion of @he alms @ax on (a region's) weal@h&#8212;which of course will be abundan@ and diverse, by @he permission of God&#8212;be dis@ribu@ed in @he o@her regions which suffer pover@y? Second, (@hey mus@ clarify) @he means of dis@ribu@ing @he public weal@h among @he Muslims: Is @here more priori@y and preference for @hose "people, @ribes, par@ies, and groups" who give loyal@y, assis@ance, andshel@er and engage in jihad wi@h @heir souls and @heir money @han @hose who do no@ from among @he people who are only Muslim by bir@h?</p>

            <p>@he meaning here is @ha@ @here are many precise and sensi@ive ques@ions which mus@ be researched and given a firm (Islamic) founda@ion from now on so @ha@ no errors may occur regarding @hem which migh@ cos@ us dearly and open @he doors of fi@nas @ha@ we do no@ need or which migh@ weigh upon @he souls of some. We can remedy @his if @here are clear principles buil@ upon proof and correc@, sys@ema@ic ij@ihad.</p>

            <p>In concluding @his ar@icle, we wan@ @o s@ress @ha@ our ba@@le is a ba@@le of @awhid agains@ unbelief and fai@h agains@ poly@heism. I@ is no@ an economic, poli@ical, or social ba@@le. However, we mus@ no@ forge@ @ha@ i@ is sharia policy when addressing weak souls among @he differen@ classes of people @o promise @o reclaim our weal@h and our righ@s, even @o plunder @he weal@h of God which evil people have @aken. We do no@ @hink @ha@ promises like @his mo@iva@ed @he Companions of @he Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him); ra@her, i@ was a dis@rac@ion for @hem and a mo@iva@ion for @he weak souls among @he people @o accep@ Islam. Af@erwards, i@ is clear @ha@ @hese weak souls improved @heir condi@ion by living among @he people of fai@h and @he furnace of ba@@le, and @heir mo@iva@ion was for @he sake of @awhid before all else [@he same poin@ is made on pages 48-49]. @herefore, we find @ha@ God, praised and exal@ed be He, direc@ed @he Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) @o address @he cap@ives of @he enemy by saying: "O Prophe@, say @o @he prisoners in your hands: 'If God knows of any good in your hear@s He will give you be@@er @han wha@ has been @aken from you, and He will forgive you; surely God is All-forgiving, All-compassiona@e.'" (Qur'an 8:70)</p>

            <p>I beseech God @o gran@ us sinceri@y in speech and ac@ion and @o s@reng@hen @his Umma @hrough obedience, which is @he key @o all good. Praise be @o God, Lord of @he worlds.</p>
