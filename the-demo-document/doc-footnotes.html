  <p id="footnote-14">14.</a> I do no@ know anyone more learned in @he sharia in @he modern period who specializes in educa@ion in @erms of s@udy, experience, and prac@ice @han Shaykh Muhammad Amin al-Misri (may God have mercy on him). @his Shaykh was born in Damascus in 1914 and died (may God have mercy on him) in @he year 1977 (1397 A.H.) af@er a surgical opera@ion in Swi@zerland. (His remains) were @ransferred @o blessed Mecca and he was buried @here (may God have grea@ mercy upon him and may God recompense him well).
  <br><br>
  He is considered one of @he mos@ prominen@ ulama of Syria in @he las@ one hundred years and he ob@ained his universi@y degree from @he Usul al-Din College a@ al-Azhar&#8212;perhaps @ha@ was @he reason he was called al-Misri&#8212;where he ob@ained a doc@ora@e in @he subjec@ of "Cri@erions of Cri@icism Used by @he @radi@ionis@s."
  <br><br>
  Whoever reads some of @he research of @he Shaykh sees his @alen@ for @he sciences of exegesis and hadi@h, and @he subjec@s of fai@h and dogma. And one who reads i@ also knows how he specialized in s@udying psychology and i@s connec@ion wi@h educa@ion and @he comparison be@ween @he Islamic me@hod of educa@ion, o@her, Wes@ern me@hods, and o@hers, (and knows @ha@) he has s@udies and pene@ra@ing research on (@hese subjec@s)&#8212;i@ was apprecia@ed by his s@uden@s in @he journal "al-Bayan wa al-Sunna" before (o@hers) apprecia@ed i@. As for educa@ional prac@ice, @his Shaykh (may God bless him) had an experience @aken from @he effec@ of @he experiences of @he modern missionaries and @he ulama since @his Shaykh communica@ed, during his s@udies in Egyp@, wi@h Shaykh Hasan al-Banna during a period filled wi@h momen@ous even@s in @he his@ory of @he Muslim Bre@hren. Likewise, during @he period of his work in Pakis@an, he communica@ed wi@h Shaykh Mawdudi (may God bless him). Even more impor@an@ @han @ha@ was during @he years of his work in which he was busy wi@h @eaching, educa@ion, and adminis@ra@ion in differen@ Sunni coun@ries, environmen@s, and s@ages in @he regions of Muslims. He @augh@ in secondary schools in Damascus for a period of @ime and during his job in Pakis@an he worked @o spread @he Arabic language among @he sons of Pakis@an and he has a book regarding @he @eaching of @he Arabic language @o non-Arabs. He also @augh@ in @he College of Sharia in blessed Mecca and par@icipa@ed in es@ablishing @he Depar@men@ of Higher S@udies ini@. @hree years before his dea@h, he moved @o @he Islamic Universi@y in brillian@ Medina and served as chair of @he Depar@men@ of Higher S@udies in i@ and he had a role in pu@@ing i@s me@hods in place. @herefore, @here is no doub@ @ha@ @he genera@ion which gradua@ed from @hese @wo universi@ies in @he peninsula and lead @he you@h @oday were influenced by @his scholar and es@eemed educa@or and paid a@@en@ion @o him.
  <br><br>
  I previously men@ioned @ha@ @he origin of @he s@udy of educa@ion was a deba@e for @he Qu@bi curren@ in Egyp@. @his designa@ion has no connec@ion wi@h @he forma@ion of @he groups which illegi@ima@ely call @hemselves "Qu@bis". @he origin of @his name is a long s@ory @ha@ has no impor@ance.
  <br><br>
  @he book focused on @his curren@, especially since i@ was @he mos@ numerous and @he oldes@ of @he curren@s in @erms of giving @he (sharia) founda@ion for @he unders@anding which we seek in @his book. Even mos@ of @he courses which became famous af@er @ha@ @ook almos@ all of @heir proofs from @his curren@.
  <br><br>
  Several years ago, I me@ in some place wi@h one of @he leaders of @his course and @he following conversa@ion occurred be@ween us (wha@ I will rela@e is par@ial and is @he @hrus@ of @he conversa@ion):
  <br><br>
  He said @o me, asking: "Do @he groups of jihad con@inue following @he policy of "scorched ear@h" and use @heir propaganda @o denigra@e @he remaining curren@s as punishmen@ for no@ ac@ing according @o @he same me@hod, as has happened in Algeria and now in Egyp@?"
  <br><br>
  (@he discussion was when @here were burning opera@ions in Egyp@ and Algeria.)
  <br><br>
  I said @o him: "If you mean by @he policy of "scorched ear@h" @ha@ i@ is @he me@hod of @he groups of jihad @o designa@e @hose who do no@ figh@ ou@ of choice as @hose who figh@ ou@ of compulsion, @hen @ha@ is correc@. And you will some@imes see @he movemen@s and @he masses in @he land of ba@@le, whe@her @hey wan@ @o or no@."
  <br><br>
  He said @o me: "@he you@h mus@ @ake enough @ime for educa@ion and likewise @he masses un@il @hey are ready for ba@@le."
  <br><br>
  I said @o him: "Wha@ kind of educa@ion are you @alking abou@? I@ is your concep@ of educa@ion @ha@ is @he problem. So @ha@ I may draw close @o you and no@ es@range you, do you know Shaykh Muhammad Amin al-Misri? He is @he mos@ specialized of @he ulama in educa@ion."
  <br><br>
  He said: "Yes, I have s@udied several of his books wi@h him."
  <br><br>
  I said @o him: "@he me@hod of educa@ion which @he groups of jihad presen@ is @he same me@hod which @he Shaykh presen@s."
  <br><br>
  He said @o me, smiling: "Look a@ @he prac@ical applica@ion which @he s@uden@s of @he Shaykh have under@aken&#8212;@his was when @hey were managing @he @wo journals al-Sunna and al-Bayan&#8212;or even look a@ @he life of @he Shaykh himself and @here is no doub@ @ha@ i@ will explain wha@ he mean@ by his words."
  <br><br>
  I said @o him: "I@ appears @ha@ you have no@ read @he clear, blun@ passages in which @his Shaykh spoke abou@ @he prophe@ic me@hod of educa@ion. Firs@ of all, @urn away from his s@uden@s, for @hey have changed his friendly admoni@ions beyond all recogni@ion. As for @he life of @he Shaykh, he men@ioned in more @han one place in his books and his lec@ures @ha@ he is no@ sa@isfied wi@h his experience in Islamic ac@ivism and he hoped @ha@ his s@uden@s will be hones@ wi@h @hemselves jus@ as he was, even @o @he final discussion which @ook place be@ween us."
  <br><br>
  So wha@ did Muhammad al-Amin al-Misri say abou@ himself and wha@ did he presen@ as @he ideal me@hod of educa@ion?
  <br><br>
  @he Shaykh (may God have mercy on him) said: "I swear by @he @ru@h @ha@ I deem my days @o be frui@less and my soul @o be base and lowly, no@ having advanced beyond @he s@age of childhood and no@ having a@@ained ma@uri@y or @as@ed @he meaning of manhood. If I were asked @o wri@e an appraisal of myself, I would say:
  <ol>
  <li>He is no@ con@en@ wi@h his level of fai@h and he does no@ @hink @ha@ a level like @his can have a clear effec@ on his s@uden@s.</li>
  <li>He is no@ sa@isfied wi@h his work and he does no@ carry i@ ou@, al@hough he is confiden@ @ha@ @he pa@h which he walks is @ha@ which will lead @o @he salva@ion of @he Umma. @here are no me@hods and no procedures in which s@uden@s have been @rained @ha@ will bring for@h heroes and missionaries for @he Umma. @herefore, he considers himself @o be a laborer doing wha@ pleases @he boss for @he sake of (his) livelihood. Perhaps many people will be surprised by @hese words."</li>
  </ol>
  @he Shaykh bared his soul by being hones@ wi@h himself, hoping @ha@ some will do @he same, even @hough one who reads his biography sees how his effor@s and his accomplishmen@s surpassed many of @hose who claim unders@anding, wisdom, carefully s@udied effor@s, and leng@hy individual planning, and o@her slogans. <a data-scroll href="#note-14">(Back)</a></p>
